Case,Recommended Solution
"Problem:
Our client is a private equity firm which operates primarily in the automotive industry.
They want us to investigate whether they should increase their portfolio in the sensor
market? Also what criteria should be used by the client to identify target companies?
Information To Be Provided:
• Market potential :
• Electronics content in automotives will keep growing and is expected to represent
17% of total purchased materials in an average vehicle by 2006.
• Sensors will become a more and more important part of the automotive
electronics content — according to a previous study conducted by us, we estimate
they will represent approximately $150 on average per vehicle by the year 2005
• Global growth potential beyond automotive e.g., aerospace, semiconductors,
medical devices and consumer electronics. Automotive and Aerospace being the
biggest growth areas
• NPV analysis: To operate a company in sensor market requires an recurring
investment of $10M, $11M and 12M resp. starting in year 0,1, 2. Our client has
done back of the envelope cash flow analysis that show that they can expect a
cash flow of $12M after the first year growing at a rate of 5%. Assume a three
year outlook is sufficient to make a decision if the client should go ahead with the
investment. Using this data, determine if the client should go ahead with the idea
of investing in the sensor market. Assume cost of capital=10%
• Key demand drivers: Increasing consumer demand; government regulation for
safety, environmental, and comfort in automotive.
• Customer buying criteria: The OEMs are the customers of sensor manufacturers
and they place a high value on leading-edge technology as electronic systems are seen
as a source of differentiation.
• Competition: The sensor market is extremely fragmented — leading sensor
companies are aggressively using acquisitions and partnerships to grow by expanding
their product, industry, geographic footprints and/or acquire promising technologies.
• Cost Structure: Being in the sensor business requires significant continuing
investments in terms of infrastructure and technology. However it is high margin
business and is likely to remain so for the next 4-5 years.","Solution:
The data provided in this case clearly presents a very positive picture of the sensor
market. The real answer lies in articulating and structuring the decision criteria for an
acquisition target for our client. The interviewee should be able to quickly highlight 2 success factors for sensor companies i.e. Profit growth potential of a company and the fit
with existing portfolio
Profit/Margin Growth Potential:
• What market segments is the company playing in? What is the growth potential of
these market segments?
• What geographies and product and services are being addressed by the company
and the future growth potential of each?
• Does the company have strong existing customer relationships?
• Technology Leadership: What is the technology focus of the company? What are
the R&D investments? How many patents are owned by the company? Etc.
• Present Value estimation using the due diligence done by the client on a
representative company in the sensor market revealed a positive return at the end
of three years.
Year 0 1 2 3 PV
Investment($M) 10 11 12 0 29.92
Cash flow ($M) 12 12.6 13.23 31.26
Net($M) 1.34

• Fit with portfolio: To what extent can we add
value to this company given the companies in
our portfolio

A better answer will also highlight the advantages and disadvantages of moving into this
market to the client in terms of the following:
Advantages:
• Access new technologies that can be potentially used by other portfolio
companies
• Expand beyond automotive industry to garner higher buy-out multiples upon exit
• Diversification of existing portfolio (currently only in automotive)
• Potential to establish industry leadership since the market is fragmented currently
• Enlarging size of entities dealing with OEM customers
Disadvantages:
• Likely expensive acquisition
• Likely significant investment required to stay competitive (continuing R&D to
invent latest sensor technologies for differentiation with competitors)
• Learning curve on managing sensor business
• Higher risks (i.e., relatively long lead time from R&D to market)"
"Case Scenario
Our client has had flat sales and declining profits for the last 3 years. The CEO believes
that high margin service businesses built on existing core competencies are the answer to
his problem.
Key Questions
From a Value Chain perspective, how would you assess whether or not there are
opportunities to build sustainable new service businesses? Develop some potential
business models based on your assessment.","Possible Recommendations / Approaches
Candidate should be able to dissect the value-chain and identify procurement as a core
competency.
One core competency of the company is the procurement department with its world-class
processes and personnel. It also has access to 2000 buyers that work for its parent
company.
The company has strong customer relationships with large manufacturing companies
such as Caterpillar, John Deere, etc.
Large manufacturing companies usually buy several hundred components (from around
500 suppliers), but build strategic relationships including electronic linkages with the top
20 suppliers.
Significant cost savings have been realized through these strategic relationships, but
extending them beyond the top 20 suppliers is not cost-effective.
Case Wrap Up
In this scenario Deloitte Consulting recommended a new business model based on the
client’s procurement competency in which it will manage suppliers that fall below the top
20 for its major strategic customers. The client leverages its web-enabled electronic
linkages to reduce costs and streamline the procurement process for components
purchased from the less-than-top-20 suppliers. The business is currently in the planning
phase."
"Case Scenario
The client is a $250 million Performance Chemicals division of a $7 billion Specialty
Chemicals Company.
The CEO of the parent company has set a “growth agenda”. He believes that his company
can become the fastest growing chemical company (moving from 3-4% historical growth
to 10-15% growth) and has asked the business units to develop and present growth
strategies to him.
Performance Chemical’s business manager, like many other managers in the company,
does not believe that there is significant untapped potential in the markets served by his
unit. He has approached Deloitte Consulting for strategic advice.
Key Questions
How would you go about building a case for whether or not Performance Chemicals
division can grow at a 10%+ per annum rate? How will you approach this problem?
Develop potential growth strategies and recommendations for the Performance
Chemicals management team.","Possible Recommendations / Approaches & Key Issues That Should be Covered
Consider Market Issues (Market Size, Customers, Competitors)
What is the expected growth rate of the existing business? All the 6 businesses have been
growing at 3-4% for the last 5 years. This is the same as the average growth rate of the
markets served.
What are some of the products sold by this division? Performance Chemicals division
sells asphalt additives, sodium chemicals, paper pulp bleaching solutions etc.
How would you describe the competitive environment? All the products have limited
intellectual property protection and are being threatened by global competition.
Commoditization and pricing pressures are constraining the growth of these businesses.
It is clear that the company has to look beyond traditional product strategy to generate
the warranted growth. What are some of the trends you would look for? E.g. outsourcing,
solutions vs. products, product-service bundles etc....
Understand Company Capabilities (i.e., Feasibility)
Are there any cultural impediments to growth? The company has like any other chemical
company focused solely on selling products and has not been seeking growth ideas.
Quote from the Client “We make it by the ton and sell it by the carload” describes the
business thinking at the client.
Probable Growth Strategies
Develop a simple framework to explore growth opportunities. E.g. Growth Spectrum may
include Product Enhancements, New Products, New Markets, New Channels, New
Business Models.
Alternative growth strategies for Performance Chemicals division – e.g., 
• Sell a solution not a product
• Become indispensable to strategic customers
• Become one-stop shop for specialty chemicals
• Vendor managed inventory system as a service to customers
Case Wrap-Up
The Deloitte team performed a growth diagnostic to understand the culture and
infrastructural impediments to growth. It conducted 2-day workshops with each of the
niche businesses to develop alternative strategies using the Valuable Formula
methodology of the strategy practice. Some of the strategies included product-service
bundling, outsourcing, and new markets for the existing technological capabilities. The
preliminary projections indicated the potential of quadrupling the size of Performance
Chemicals group to $1 Billion in 5 years. The client agreed with Deloitte Consulting’s
recommendation and has implemented a subset of the strategies."
"Case Scenario
The client is a provider of wealth advisory services to high-net-worth individuals.
Typical wealth advisory services include: investment strategy and portfolio management,
estate and trust planning, tax planning and preparation, insurance planning, family office
services (e.g., bill payment services) and the like. The client started out as a professional
services specialist to corporate clients, but over time, has successfully expanded into
individual wealth advisory services. Over time, the revenues generated from the wealth
advisory services component of the company grew to over $400M worldwide.
Traditional players in this market are high-end private banks (e.g., JP Morgan), and
boutique financial planners. These players do not offer their own products, but typically
have close partnerships or affiliations with those who do (e.g., mutual fund companies,
insurance companies and brokerage houses).
Within the last 12 months, several disruptive events have occurred in the marketplace.
Large and diversified financial services players are launching aggressive national
marketing campaigns around their wealth advisory services businesses, and the results are
paying off as they begin to capture an alarming share of the market in a short period of
time. In addition, a new, completely different type of competitor has announced its
presence and intent to enter the wealth advisory services market, offering a value
proposition very similar to the client’s. This new concern is well funded, and has some
of the most successful venture capitalists of the day filling the seats on its board of
directors. This new competitor is also causing significant problems for the client; within
the past 3 months, the top five producing partners have left to join this firm, taking their
clients with them, and leaving the client’s geographic presence in a strategically critical
growth area significantly weakened. In addition, the client is finding that its revenues are
decreasing significantly in certain types wealth advisory services they offer.
The client has retained the services of Deloitte Consulting to help them understand what
their strategic response options are, and to recommend the best course of action to follow.
Key Interview Questions
Assume you have just joined the Deloitte Consulting team for this project and today is
the project kick-off meeting. What would be your hypothesis around the root cause of
the client’s issues and what information would you want to look at to determine the best
recommendation for the client? What information do you need to arrive at your
hypothesis? What do you feel are the strategic options facing the client?","The company differentiates itself in the wealth advisory market by offering independent
and objective advice to its clients, recommending only those products and services
warranted by the investment strategy and the client’s particular risk profile. The client
does not form formal partnerships or alliances with product suppliers (e.g., investment
banks and fund managers).
The Client is known worldwide for its expertise in its legacy businesses: corporate tax
preparation & advisory services, as well as audit services. About 75% of its business is
in tax preparation and services, the remaining is in wealth advisory services, but both its
market share and the market itself is growing. As tax preparers and auditors,
independence and objectivity is not only critical, it is required and monitored by the SEC.
The company offers its wealth advisory services using the same model as for tax
preparation (e.g., fee per hour).
While its position as independent and objective differentiates itself vis-à-vis the product
players, it limits the areas it can control in the value chain:
plan  advise  execute  reassess and modify
(determine goals) (develop plan) (based on performance,
and chgs to risk profile)
Due to SEC restrictions, the client is not allowed to execute transactions (e.g., the
purchase of securities, taking custody of funds, etc.); it must advise and recommend only.
Other players, many of them competitors, such as banks, mutual fund companies,
insurance companies, are the ones who are ultimately able to execute. As a result, the
client cannot control who develops relationships with their customers. The key part of
the value chain to control is link between “advise” and “execute” in that controlling the
relationship with the customer is controlling the execution and the quality of the
execution, and blocking or limiting the role of these other players who execute services.
While the client offers and sells a vast portfolio of services to its customers, the amount
of revenues generated from services other than tax preparation and advice has been
declining. (the customer is retreating to purchasing services that the client is branded and
well-known for, seeking investment advisory services from better known names (e.g.,
investment banks) who have entered the market and have aggressive marketing
campaigns).
Understand Competitive shifts: Which competitors are entering the market?
During the past few years, the number of players entering the wealth advisory services
space has grown considerably. Investment banks, mutual fund companies and brokerage
firms have all entered this realm, and many are targeting the affluent segment.
The New Economy is disrupting this market. In addition to investment banks and private
banks entering the market, pure online players such as e*Trade are aligning with
traditional high-end banks (e.g., Northern Trust) to offer their affluent clients online
trading and account monitoring capability. Finally, a new entrant, myCFO.com is a pure
internet play that competes directly with the client in the independent and objective
advice category, but does so without being burdened with the restrictions of being a
public accounting and audit firm (e.g., they are able to strike alliances, partnerships, and
can offer its customers access to invest in venture capital funds).
Why are they entering the market?
Investment banks, mutual fund companies and other diversified financial institutions
(Schwab, AmEx) have heavily invested in IT to support the Internet brokerage and
trading business. They are now leveraging their IT capabilities by expanding into wealth
advisory services, bolstered by offering online customer accounts, where customers can
access their accounts and advisors 24/7. Many are entering into this area because
margins for these services are higher than commissions on trades (brokerage fees), which
are shrinking due to downward pressure brought about by discount online trading options
such as e*Trade. Launch of these premium online customer accounts is being bolstered
by aggressive national advertising campaigns.
Understand Market (and Customer) shifts:
The tremendous wealth creation occurring in the mid to late 90s has created a growing
number of affluent individuals in the United States (“Affluent” = net worth exceeding
$1M). While the market for wealth advisory services to affluent individuals is growing,
the market for independent and objective advice is unclear, because the value placed on
independence and objectivity in this space is unclear. Competitors who are clearly not
objective (e.g., investment banks and mutual fund companies), are positioning its wealth
advisory services as independent and objective. The major question is whether or not the
customer appears to appreciate the difference between a true provider of objective advice,
and those positioning themselves as “pseudo-objective”. Is this critical, single
differentiating factor that separates our client from its larger, better funded and more IT
enabled competitors – valued enough to sustain the business?
Evaluate the Strategic Options available to the client:
Option 1: Exit the wealth advisory services portion of the business (about 25% of overall
revenues, the remainder comes from tax and audit services); Option 2: stay with the
current strategy of offering objective and independent advice but invest to develop an IT
platform to offer an online offering to its clients; Option 3: assess the market for
“independent and objective advice” (e.g., evaluate whether this attribute is strategically
sound as the core differentiating attribute).
Case Wrap-Up
STRATEGIC OPTIONS: The Deloitte Consulting Team recommended several options:
• Exit the business;
• Stay in the business and invest incrementally to remain competitive (e.g., expand
existing practices, bring in more experienced hires);
• Stay in the business and aggressively invest to develop an IT-based customer channel
• Spin off the business from the core business of tax and audit and pursue more
aggressive alliance and JV strategies.
Choosing the option involves addressing the central key issue: what is the market for
independent and objective advice? We recommended the client address this issue before
making a decision on the option to pursue:
Deloitte Consulting recommended that the client initiate a conjoint analysis study to
determine the relative value placed on this attribute vs. cost and other attributes.
In addition, Deloitte Consulting examined how, as a public accounting firm, is it possible
to exert more control over the execution portion of the value chain.
Deloitte Consulting recommended that the client initiate a developmental program in
house to mentor and develop client service professionals to become “Most Trusted
Advisors” – deepening the relationship with current clients to sell the full scope of wealth

advisory services (not just tax services). In doing so, the client became a more customer-
centric organization, focusing on serving the specific and evolving needs of its customer

base."
"Problem:
The client is a warehouser that purchases a range of telephony technologies (simple and
complicated) from original manufacturers, and then sells them to a group of resellers,
who in turn sell them to end consumers.
Manufacturer  CLIENT  Reseller  End Consumer
The reseller market can be divided into Corporate (largest), Value-Added (medium), and
E-tailer (smallest) segments. Our client has experienced eight quarters of declining
profit. Attempt to answer why and provide recommendations to reverse this trend.
If Asked for Market Information:
The client is the largest company in the industry, with a number two competitor almost as
large and several smaller players. There have been no new market entrants in recent
years and all firms sell at industry-wide prices. The industry can be divided exclusively
into three segments, for which the following data exist:

E-tailers 10 2,500,000 2,000 E-tailers 5 2,000,000 1,000","Solution:
The calculations from the above table should lead the interviewee to the following
conclusions:
• The overall industry has shrunk, both on a price and volume basis (“it’s a bad
business to be in”)
• The client’s overall market share has shrunk from roughly 33% to 25%
• Value-added is the largest segment and client has lost the most market share in it
The falling prices can be interpreted to mean that a price war has begun in the industry,
perhaps due to short-sighted competitive responses to new technologies. The falling
volume can be interpreted to mean that the client and its competitors are getting cut out of
the value chain, as manufacturers have begun to sell directly to resellers and end
consumers.
Based on the available data, deteriorating metrics across the board suggest that the
industry is mature and rapidly approaching obsolescence. Absent novel opportunities for
differentiation, there is little that the client can do to return to profitability under these
market conditions. Recommendations should recognize this reality and likely address
options for exiting the industry via diversification, firm sale, and/or closure."
"Problem:
Our client is a US bus transport operator maintaining routes between cities. The company
has lost money for the past several years and over-operated routes as well as recent route
additions are suspected to be responsible. A new CEO has now taken charge and
determined that the company needs to aggressively cut costs in order to return to
profitability. How would you approach the problem?
Information To Be Provided If Requested:
1. Routes are of three types: short, medium or long. More than half of the revenue
comes from long distance trips
2. The company has a substantial real estate investment in terminals
3. The prior CEO focused on top line; instituted plans like anywhere pickup
4. Cash position is tight – the company had a recent brush with bankruptcy
5. Its equipment is quite old
6. The largest cost for a bus company is fuel","Solution:
The candidate is expected to use a profitability framework, and focus more on costs than
other aspects because of the nature of the problem.
Costs can be divided into Fixed and Variable Costs.
Fixed Costs: Buses, stations and other buildings, salaried employees, etc.
Variable Costs: Gas, hourly employees, maintenance (debatable whether variable)
Costs could be cut on possibly all of the above areas. Here are some specific suggestions:
• Determine which routes are profitable and cut back on the unprofitable routes – a
good metric to use would be the load factor
• Change routes in a way that can improve the load factor
• Think about oil contracts to protect against oil price fluctuations
• Lease new equip. to decrease maintenance costs, downtime, and fuel efficiency
• Reconsider “anywhere pickup” and utilize more freeways to improve schedules
and utilization of equipment (bonus point)
The other part of cost cutting would be to compare the services provided to customers
with what they really want. For example, there may be costs involved with extra terminal
services or increasing leg room on new seats that are not valued by consumers.
Essentially, the offering must be realigned with customer needs.
Follow-Up Question: If the company figures out 25 new routes that may be profitable,
how one would go about starting service on those routes.
Possible Response to Follow-Up Question:
The company would need to look at the operating costs per route, competition on each
route, whether the company’s infrastructure could support the new routes, and what
potential customers on these routes want (they are likely not riders on the company’s
existing routes.)"
"Problem Statement:
Your client is a premium brand apparel retailer. In recent years it has noticed a consistent
decrease in market share. How would you structure your analysis?
Information To Be Provided If Requested:
Industry and Market Share:
• Market share has fallen from 15% to 7%
• Competitors consist of premium retailers in the same business segment. There is
growing competition from substitutes and mid-range brands as well
• The market size has been growing steadily
• There have been no recent major consolidations in the industry
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution:
• There have been no substantial changes in the company’s marketing mix or
distribution
• Prices have remained constant
• Competitor marketing / pricing / product mix has remained unchanged
• Distribution is primarily through large retail outlets that stock multiple products
(70%). The balance (30%) is distributed through self-owned outlets and smaller
merchants
• Distributors have recently launched their own premium product brands
• Currently there is no online sales channel
Cost: No recent changes in cost structure or profit margins
Customers
• Customers are not price sensitive
• Customer recognition of the company’s brand is low","Solution:
The company is not diversified enough in terms of its distribution channels. The
company’s principal distribution channel has launched its own set of products in direct
competition with our client’s products. The distributor has control over shelf space and
earns a higher margin on its own products than by selling our clients’ products. Thus it
has been pushing sales of its own products at the cost of our client’s products. To
counteract this, our client must consider diversifying its distribution channel. Possible
options include:
• More self-owned stores
• Creation of an online store
In each case, the client must consider the possible impacts of these new channels on the
company’s brand. In addition, the company must work to strengthen customer pull
through a significant branding program. This would encourage customers to demand
client products through both old and new distribution channels."
"Problem:
Your client is the division of a global consumer products company that produces
toothbrushes. Its product portfolio consists primarily of a “manual” toothbrush that
retails for $3 and an electric “rechargeable” toothbrush that retails for $50. One year ago,
a new competitor introduced a battery-powered electric “spinbrush” that retails for $5 and
now controls 1% of the worldwide toothbrush market. Your client currently lacks a
comparable offering and would like to know whether it should develop a similar product.
Hint: (to be provided only if interviewee struggles significantly with the initial
structuring of the problem)
The client typically views the market in terms of margins and “per customer per year”
metrics.
Information To Be Provided If Specifically Requested:
One year ago, the worldwide market was made up of 80% manual and 20% rechargeable
toothbrushes. The spinbrush’s 1% market share gain has come mostly at the expense of
rechargeable toothbrush sales.
Manual:
• The client’s net profit margin on sales of manual toothbrushes is 66%
• The average manual toothbrush user goes through 4 toothbrushes per year
• On average, 2 toothbrushes per year are given to manual toothbrush users free of charge by their dentists
Rechargeable:
• Rechargeable toothbrushes are sold as two separate components: a “base” that retails for $50 (with a
60% net profit margin) and an associated “head” that retails for $5 (with a 90% net profit margin)
• 1 base and 1 head are needed at all times for the device to work; no other components are compatible
• The average base last 10 years
• The average rechargeable toothbrush user goes through 2 heads per year and purchases bases as needed
Spinbrush:
• No specific cost data is known for the competitor’s spinbrush offering
• Client product development believes it could produce a spinbrush “knockoff” at a cost of $3 per brush
Analysis:
The most effective approach should begin by calculating figures in terms of profit per
customer per year.
Manual:
[2 toothbrushes purchased] x [$3 retail] x [66% profit margin] = [$4 profit per customer
per year]
Rechargeable:
([2 heads purchased] x [$5 retail] x [90% profit margin]) + ([1/10 base] x [50 retail] x
[60% profit margin])
= [$12 profit per customer per year]
Spinbrush:
Assuming production costs would be the same for the client and its competitor:
[2 toothbrushes purchased] x ([$5 retail] – [$3 cost of production]) = [$4 profit per
customer per year]","Solution:
At this point the analysis becomes more qualitative in nature. While the manual and
spinbrush products are similar in terms of profitability, the manual toothbrush addresses
the mass market (80% market share at a $3 retail price point) and is unlikely to lose share
to the spinbrush. However, the rechargeable segment is most profitable for the client and
is clearly threatened by the introduction of the spinbrush. If the client were to respond
with a “knockoff” spinbrush, it would likely hasten the demise of its profitable
operations. Therefore, the client should consider alternative means to respond to the
spinbrush “disruptive technology”."
"Problem:
As an established consultant with McKinsey, you have volunteered your time to critique

business plans at a local entrepreneur’s forum. One plan calls for establishing door-to-
door distribution of an already existing online newspaper in Cologne, the fourth-largest

city in Germany. Without detailed knowledge of how the process would work in
practice, how might you evaluate the feasibility of the proposed distribution plan?
Information To Be Provided If Requested:
No external capital has been provided, and resources only allow for the hiring of 6
newspaper carriers on bicycles, each of whom will be responsible for one square
kilometer within the downtown area of the city.
You should use simplifying assumption that the city is in the shape of a square and the
population is evenly distributed in homes that are an equal distance apart from each other.
Also ignore non-residential areas and assume no “stacking” of homes.
The newspaper is scheduled to be printed and ready for distribution by 4AM each
morning, and must be delivered by 6AM to meet customer requirements.
* Key assumption the interviewee must make (reorient them if they assume something far
from this figure): subscriber homes within the proposed distribution area are on average
10 meters apart from each other.
Analysis:
One way to assess the feasibility of the plan is to calculate how quickly the newspaper
carrier must deliver a single newspaper, and evaluate whether that sounds like a
reasonable figure.
If the interviewee has difficulty conceptualizing the problem, sketch a rough estimation
of this graph to guide his/her thinking:
By assuming that homes are 10 meters apart from each other on average, each side of the
square must contain 100 homes ([1,000 meters] / [10 meters between each home]).
Therefore, a square kilometer contains 10,000 “stops” for the newspaper carrier ([100
“stops” per row] x [100 rows of homes]. Given only 7,200 seconds to complete the job
([2 hours] x [60 minutes per hour] x [60 seconds per minute]), the newspaper carrier
would need to deliver more than one newspaper per second, which is likely impossible.","Solution:
Due to the budget constraints of the business plan, hiring more newspaper carriers is not a
valid option. Two potential solutions include the following:
1) Reduce distribution area – Pare back distribution to reach only the most profitable
potential subscribers
2) Change distribution method – Co-distribute with other publications and/or locate
alternative channels"
"Problem:
Your client is a large music company that developed via a merger several years ago
between an American and a European business. It is currently the #2 player in the market
with 25% market share and $75 billion in revenue. During the last holiday season, the
company suffered an abnormally large degree of stockouts, causing its retailers to be
unable to replenish the CDs on its shelves. What went wrong and what should the
company do to prevent this in the future?
Information To Be Provided If Requested:
The “music industry supply chain” can be structured as follows:
Artists & Content  Physical Production  Distribution  Retailers
Time, communication, and transportation costs must be factored into each “handoff” in the supply chain.
Supply chain phase descriptions:
• Artists & Content: Typically the longest phase, with a wide range of variability in length
• Physical Production: Typically the shortest phase, often a few seconds, managed in-house by the client
• Distribution: Storage and transportation via distribution centers between manufacture and retail locations
• Retailers: Store shelves, hot-selling items have lead times that are short, but not unreasonable
Supply chain relations:
• Artists & Content: No standard operating procedures in place to deal with music content providers
• Physical Production: In-house
• Distribution: Good relations and variability management mechanisms with 150-200 distributor network
• Retailers: Strong relations, good communications, and information sharing with end retailers
Artists & Content Process Detail (if requested):
• Content relationships are often contractual arrangements with recording studios and independent artists
• There are no guidelines to manage “the creative process”, which rarely conforms to set timetables
• There are no standardized decision-making procedures for how and when contacts come up for review
• The above factors contribute to the extremely high rate of variability in this phase of the supply chain","Analysis:
Detailed probing of the “music industry supply chain” should reveal bottlenecks in the
Artist & Content phase and resulting handoff, even when the rest of process is generally
marked by best-in-class procedures. The interviewee should demonstrate understanding
that high process variability and front end delays can lead to supply chain disruptions and
ultimately product stockouts. These factors are particularly likely to cause problems
during periods of high demand, such as the retail holiday season. A detailed supply chain
management process needs to address the unusual circumstances and variability of “the
creative process.”"
"Problem:
Your client is a manufacturer of test equipment for electronics companies. This is a high
complexity, low volume business, where products range from $10,000 to $1 million.
Products are built from sets of standard subassemblies, which the manufacturer holds in
stock. When customers order a product, the Sales department determines customer
requirements and configures the product using these subassemblies.
Currently, the client holds 183 days worth of inventory on average. Best-in-class
companies hold 39 days. The client would like you to help reduce inventories to 85 days
or less. How would you go about achieving this?
Guidelines for Building the Supply Chain:
The candidate should begin by trying to understand the supply chain. The following
information can be provided as the candidate works through the supply chain model:
1. After the order is received, the client assembles the product out of subassemblies
and base units
2. Subassemblies are essentially circuit boards, which are designed by the client.
Manufacturing of these circuit boards is outsourced, with a cycle time of
approximately 1-2 weeks
3. Components used to manufacture subassemblies are purchased and maintained by
the client, and sent to the outsourced manufacturer for assembly. These
components fall in two categories of approximately equal dollar value:
a. A large number of “standard” off-the-shelf components are purchased
from distributors as needed. Lead times for standard components are
approximately 1-2 weeks
b. A smaller number of “custom” components are designed by the client and
manufactured in low volumes by large semiconductor manufacturers.
Lead times for custom components are approximately 9 months, with little
opportunity for improvement

4. For a typical subassembly, 33% of the cost is made up of standard components,
33% of the cost is made up of custom components, and 33% of the cost is
assembly at the outsourced location
Additional Information:
1. The client currently guarantees 4 weeks delivery time to the customers upon order
receipt
2. Inventory is comprised mainly of base units (little dollar value) and subassemblies
(high dollar value). Although there are only a few base units in the final offering,
the total number of product configurations with different features and
subassemblies is as high as 26,000
3. Some subassemblies move very fast, while some others move slowly, and
occasionally have to be scrapped because a new version of the product is offered","Solution:
There is no “aha” to this case, however, the candidate is to be tested on developing an
understanding of the supply chain, and asking the right questions to extract all the above
information. A few key points:
• Has the client looked into reducing the number of subassemblies? One way to do
this could be making subassemblies that do a large set of functions, but enabling
only a smaller set requested and paid for by the customer. This would allow for
pooling of the demand and reduce its variation, which would in turn lead to lower
inventories
• Standard components can be procured by the outsourced manufacturer if they
have demand for these components for their other customers. This would reduce
the inventory being carried by the client, again because of pooling
• Given that the client promises 4-week delivery, it might be possible to hold
inventory in raw components rather than subassemblies and have it manufactured
on demand. If feasible, this could reduce the cost of inventory by one third"
"Problem:
Your client is a US-based provider of fire and water remediation services, which
primarily provide extensive cleaning in the aftermath of damages related to burning and
flooding. The company is typically hired by insurance companies on behalf of
consumers and businesses. While this existing business is quite profitable, your client
has asked for counsel on whether to enter the US residential cleaning market (traditional
housecleaning, which typically takes place 2-4 times per month.)
Pre-Case (Market Sizing Exercise):
How would you go about estimating the size of the residential cleaning market?
Potential Answer to Pre-Case:
• The population of the United States is roughly 300 million people, or about 100 million households
• These households can be roughly split in half according to whether they earn more than $75,000 per year
• Estimate the willingness to pay for housecleaning services at 40% of households making more than
$75,000 per year and 10% of households making less than $75,000 per year (interviewer to confirm)
• [50 million households] x [40%] + [50 million households] x [10%] = [25 million purchases per year]
• Assumed annual housecleaning fees of $2,000 (interviewer to confirm) = market size of $50 billion
Information To Be Provided If Requested:
The US market for housecleaning services is roughly $50 billion (see pre-case), with
stable growth of 4%.
Competition:
• National Players (10% of market) – Includes national housecleaning companies such as “Dial-A-Maid”
• Regional Players (20% of market) – Includes regional services such as “Joe’s Chicago Cleaning Service”
• Individuals (60-70% of market) – Includes individuals who are often not part of a formal organization
Customers:
• Customer purchase criteria generally range along a spectrum with “price” and “quality” on each end
• Buyers from National Players typically rate “quality” as most important, buyers from Individuals
typically rate “price” as most important, and buyers from Regional Players consider a mix of both
Profitability:
• The average price for a 5-hour housecleaning job is $75 (based on data from National Players)
• Client labor costs are roughly $10 per hour and one job consumes roughly $5 worth of cleaning supplies
Synergy Considerations:
• While significantly “lower impact”, the household cleaning process is similar to the remediation process
• The client could leverage its client contacts and customer service ratings in the cleaning market
• However, the sales process for cleaning services is quite different (no sales via insurance companies)","Solution:
The US market for housecleaning services is large and attractive, and the client has
transferable skills, client contacts, and customer service capabilities that would facilitate
a relatively smooth market entry.
A preliminary margin analysis suggests that the client could operate profitably against the
National Players for the quality-conscious customer segment:
([$75 price] – [5 hours x $10 hourly labor costs] – [$5 cleaning costs]) / [$75 price] =
27% profit margin
Despite these favorable indications, the client will need to develop a tailored value
proposition to quality-conscious customers and anticipate likely competitor reactions
before proceeding with full market entry."
"Problem:
• Your client is a manufacturer of bicycles
• They have been in business for 25 years
• They manufacturer and sell three categories of bicycles:
o Racing bikes: High end, high performance bikes for sophisticated cyclists
o Mainstream bikes: Durable, but not overly complicated bikes for everyday
riders
o Children’s bikes: Smaller, simpler versions of their mainstream bikes for
children

• Profits at your client have decreased over the past five years
Question:
• What is driving the decline in overall profits?
• What recommendations might correct the situation?
Analysis:
The first question is to determine what has caused overall profits to decrease. To
accomplish this, the candidate must first understand what has transpired in each of the
three product categories over the past five years during which profitability has slipped.
The following are questions and answers that would be provided in an interview scenario.
• What are the client’s margins for a bicycle in each of the three segments?
o Racing: Cost = $600/unit, Profit=$300/unit
o Mainstream: Cost = $250/unit, Profit = $75/unit
o Children’s: Cost = $ 200/unit, Profit = $50/unit
• What has happened to the market size of each of the three segments over the past five
years?
o Racing: Has remained constant at its present size of $300MM
o Mainstream: Has increased at 2% growth rate per year to its present size of
$1.0B
o Children’s: Has increased at 3% growth rate per year to its present size of
$400MM

• What has happened to our client’s market share in each of these segments?
o Racing: Market share has decreased from 60% to 30%
o Mainstream: Market share has increased from 0% to 5%
o Children’s: Market share has increased from 0% to 3%
• Who are the client’s major competitor’s in each market segment? What has happened
to their market share in each segment over the past five years?
o Racing: There is one main competitor and a host of small firms. Your main
competitor has increased market share from 30% to 50%
o Mainstream: There exist many, large competitors, none of which holds more
than 10% of the market
o Children’s: As in the mainstream segment, there are many competitors, none
with more than 10% of the market

The above information provides enough information to put together a picture of why
profits have decreased over the past five years : Your client, with a commanding position
in a flat market segment (racing), expanded into new segments (mainstream and
children’s). As this occurred, market share decreased dramatically in the most lucrative
segment (racing), creating an unfavorable mix.
The extent to which profits have decreased can be deduced from some quick math :
profits have slipped from $60MM five years ago (=60% x $300MM x 33% racing
margin) to $44MM today ( = (30% x $300MM x 33% racing margin) + (5% x $1B x
23% mainstream margin) + (3% x $400MM x 20% children’s margin)).
The dramatic decrease in market share in the racing segment is at this point still
unexplained. Questions that would help formulate an explanation include:
• Have there been any major changes in product quality in your client’s racing product?
Or in its main competitor’s racing product?
o No
• Have there been any major price changes in your client’s racing product? Or in its
main competitor’s racing product?
o No
• Have there been any major changes in distribution outlets for your client’s racing
product? Or for its main competitor’s racing product?
o Yes
o Previously your client and its main competitor in the racing segment sold
exclusively through small, specialty dealers. This remains unchanged for the
competition.
o Your client, however, began to sell its racing bikes through mass distributors
and discount stores (the distribution outlets for mainstream and children’s
bikes) as it entered the mainstream and children’s segment.

• How do the mass distributors and discount stores price the racing bikes relative to the
specialty stores?
o Prices at these stores tend to be 15 to 20% less.
• What percent of your client’s racing sales occur in mass distributors and discount
stores?
o Effectively none. This attempt to sell through these distributors has failed
• How has the decision to sell through mass distributor’s and discount stores affected
the image of the client’s racing product?
o No studies have been done.
• How has the decision to sell through mass distributor’s and discount stores affected
your client’s relationship with the specialty outlets?
o Again, no formal analysis has been performed.
Although some analysis and/or survey should be performed to answer more conclusively
the last two questions, a possible story can be put together. There has been no appreciable
change in either quality or price (or any other tangible factor) of your client’s racing
product relative to its competition. It is not the product that is the problem, but rather its
image. As your client came out with lower end, mainstream, and children’s products and
began to push their racing segment through mass distributors and discount outlets, their
reputation was compromised. Additionally, the presence of the racing products in the
discount outlets has put your historic racing distributor (the specialty shops) in a
precarious position. The specialty shops must now lower price to compete, thereby
cutting their own profits. Instead, they are likely to push the competition’s product.
Remember, your client has no direct sales force at the retail outlets. The specialty shops
essentially serve as your client’s sales force.
The above analysis offers an explanation of what has affected the top side of the
profitability problem. Still to be examined is the cost, or bottom side, of the profitability
issue. Questions to uncover cost issues would include:
• How does the client account for its costs?
o The client has a single manufacturing and assembly plant. They have separate
lines in this facility to produce racing, mainstream and children’s products.
They divide their costs into the following categories: labor, material and
overhead. Overall costs have been increasing at a fairly hefty rate of 10% per
year.

• What is the current breakdown of costs along these categories for each product
segment?
o Racing: Labor = 30%, Material = 40%, Overhead = 30%
o Mainstream: Labor = 25%, Material = 40%, Overhead = 35%
o Children’s: Labor = 25%, Material = 40%, Overhead = 35%
• How has this mix of expenses changed over the past five years?
o In all segments, labor is an increasing percentage of the costs.
• Does the basic approach to manufacturing (i.e. the mix of labor and technology)
reflect that of its competition?
o Your client tells you that there is a continuing movement to automate and
utilize technology to improve efficiency throughout the industry, but it is
his/her opinion that their approach, maintaining the “human touch”, is what
differentiates them from the competition. (Unfortunately, he’s right!!)
• Is the workforce unionized?
o Yes
• What is the average age of the workforce?
o 52 and climbing. There is very little turnover in the workforce.
• What is the present throughput rating? How has it changed over the past five years?
o Presently the plant is producing at about 80% of capacity. This has been
decreasing steadily over the last several years.
• What is the typical reason for equipment shutdown?
o Emergency repair
• Describe the preventive maintenance program in effect at the client’s facility?
o Preventive maintenance is performed informally based on the knowledge of
senior technicians.

• How often has equipment been replaced? Is this consistent with the original
equipment manufacturer’s recommendations?
o The client feels that most OEM recommendations are very conservative. They
have followed a philosophy of maximizing the life of their equipment and
have generally doubled OEM recommendations.

The above information is sufficient to add some understanding to the cost side of the
equation. Your client has an aging workforce and plant that is behind the times in terms
of technology and innovation. This has contributed to excessive breakdowns, decreased
throughput, increased labor rates (wages increase with seniority) and greater labor hours
(overtime to fix broken machines).
In proposing recommendations to improve the client’s situation, there is no single correct
approach. There are a number of approaches that might be explored and recommended.
The following are some possibilities:
• Abandon the mainstream and children’s segment to recover leadership in the racing
segment
Issues to consider in this approach:
o How much of the racing segment is “recoverable”?
o What are the expected growth rates of each segment?
o How badly damaged is the relationship with the specialty outlets?
o Are there alternative outlets to the specialty shops such as internet sales?
o How will this move affect overall utilization of the operating facilities?
• Maintain the mainstream and children’s segment, but sell under a different name
Issues to consider in this approach:
o Is there demand among the mass and discount distributors for bicycles under
their name?
o What additional advertising and promotions costs might be incurred?
o What are the expected growth rates of each segment?
o What is driving the buying habits of the mainstream and children’s market?
• Reduce costs through automation and innovation
Issues to be considered:
o What technological improvements are to be made?
o What are the required investments?
o What are the expected returns on those investments?
o How will these investments affect throughput?
o To which lines are these investments appropriate?
o Are the mainstream and children’s segments potentially “over-engineered”?
o What impact will this have on the required workforce levels?
o If layoffs are required to achieve the benefits, what impact will this have on
labor relations?

• Reduce costs through establishing a formal preventive maintenance program
Issues to be considered:
o What organizational changes will be required?
o What analysis will be performed to determine the appropriate amount of PM?
o What training is required of the workforce?
o What technical or system changes are required?
o How will the unionized workforce respond?","Key Takeaways:
This case can prove to be lengthy and very involved. It is not expected that a candidate
would cover all of the above topics, but rather work through selected topics in a logical
fashion. It is important that the candidate pursue a solution that considers both revenue
and cost issues to impact profit. Additionally, a candidate’s ability to work comfortably
with the quantitative side of this case is important. The above recommendations for
improving profitability are just a few among many. The candidate may come with
his/her own ideas."
"Problem:
• Your client is a US-based manufacturer of branded cookies (cookies that carry the
name of the manufacturer)
• Recently private label cookies (those carrying the name of the retailer) have emerged
and threatened branded cookies
• Private label cookies emerged five years ago
• Two and one-half years ago they made up 10% of the overall cookie market (brand
being the other 90%)
• Today they make up approximately 20% of the overall cookie market (i.e., there has
been a steady, linear increase of private label portion of the overall cookie market
during the past five years)
• The overall cookie market has been relatively flat over the past five years
• Private label cookies are made by the same manufacturers who make branded cookies,
they are just sold under the name of the retailer
• There are essentially three major competitors to consider:
o Your client, who makes only branded cookies
o A second major player, that makes both branded cookies and supplies cookies
for private labelers
o A collection of small outfits, that make both branded cookies and supply
private labelers

• Distribution occurs primarily through one of two types of outlets:
• Grocery outlets: all grocers sell branded cookies, most also carry their own private
label cookies. This represents approximately 90% of total cookie sales
• Mass merchandisers (ex. Walmart, Sam’s, etc.): sell only branded cookies
Question:
• How large would you estimate the overall U.S. cookie market to be in terms of $?
• How large of a threat do you believe the trend in private label cookie sales to be to
your client?
• Based on your assessment, what is an appropriate strategy for your client to follow?","Solution:
The first question, estimating the size of the U.S. cookie market, has no right or wrong
answer. It is a test of a candidate’s ability to make reasonable assumptions and work
quickly with numbers on an “order of magnitude” level. One acceptable response would
be to estimate the number of U.S. households, estimate household consumption over
some period of time, estimate the average cost of a bag of cookies, and project out for
one year. In this case, after an estimate has been made, the candidate would be told to
assume the market size is $1Billion to simplify any future calculations. As stated in the
upfront information, the market is assumed to have been flat for the past five years.
The second question is more involved. It involves determining to what extent your client
is threatened by the increasing percent of the overall cookie market represented by
private label sales. To better answer this question information should be gathered
pertaining to what is driving the demand for private label cookies, to what extent this has
already affected your client’s sales, and what the likelihood is for the trend to continue.
The following are questions and answers that would be provided in an interview scenario.
What are the sales trends for the client over the past five years?
Your client’s sales have been flat at $600M for the time frame of five to two and one-half
years ago. Over the past two and one-half years, sales have decreased steadily down to a
present level of $560MM.
How has market share of the private label segment been split over the past five years
between your client’s main competitor and the other smaller players?
The smaller players combined had 100% of the private label sub segment five years ago.
Two and one-half years ago your client’s main competitor began supplying private
labelers. Today, this main competitor owns 40% of the private label sub segment, the
smaller players own the remaining 60%
How has market share of the branded segment been split over the past five years?
Your client held 60% of this segment five years ago, 67% two and one-half years ago and
70% today. Its main competitor held 30% five years ago, 25% two and one-half years ago
and 23% today. The combined smaller players owned 10% five years ago, 8% two and
one-half years ago and 7% today.
Analysis of the above information tells a very important story. The private label segment
was launched five years ago by the smaller players. As private label first cut into the
branded segment, it came at the expense of your client’s main competitor and the smaller
players, not your client. In response to this, your client’s main competitor entered into the
private label segment two and one-half years ago. This further hurt their own sales and
those of the smaller players, but also began to hurt your client’s sales. Additional
information is required to understand what is driving the demand for private label cookies
How does the quality of a private label cookie compare to that of a branded cookie?
Consumer studies have shown that there is a noticeable difference in taste, texture and
quality in favor of the branded cookies
At the manufacturing level, what is the difference in cost of production and price between
branded and private label products?
It costs approximately $1.50 to manufacture a bag of private label cookies which will sell
for $2.00 to retailers. It costs approximately $2.00 to manufacture a bag of branded
cookies which will sell for $2.75.
How do the same numbers translate at the retail level?
A retailer, paying $2.00 for private label cookies can sell that product for $2.50. The
$2.75 bag of branded cookies can be sold for $3.50.
The key finding is that from a cost-price-margin perspective it is advantageous for both
the manufacturers and the retailers, with all else equal, to sell a bag of branded cookies.
Other factors must be contributing to the demand for private label cookies. Think about
the incentives at each level in the chain (manufacturer, retailer, consumer). The following
questions can help fill in details
Have any of the manufacturers been able to gain additional shelf space for branded
products by supplying grocers with private label products?
No
Has their been excess capacity at your client, its main competitor or the smaller
competitors that has been used up through the manufacturing of private label products?
There was some excess capacity at the smaller competitors and your client’s main
competitor (your client is unsure as to how much).. There is little excess capacity
anywhere in the industry today.
.
Has your client’s relationship with its retailers suffered as a result of it not supplying
private label products?
Not noticeably
Are grocery stores using private labels in other food categories?
Yes, there has been a major push by grocery stores to populate shelves with private labels
Is competition increasing or decreasing among grocers?
Generally increasing. Grocer chains are expanding and the number of grocers to be found
serving a given area has generally increased over the past five years
What general macroeconomic trends have occurred over the past five years?
The economy has been slowing over the past five years. There is concern about recession
The above information begins to expose a clearer story. A number of factors have
contributed to the emergence of the private label segment: manufacturer’s interest in
utilizing excess capacity, grocer’s desire to sell products with their name on it (they may
believe this creates return customers in an increasing competitive environment),
consumers concerns about a troubled economy (price vs. quality tradeoffs).
At this point the candidate would be encouraged to state what they believe the magnitude
of the private label threat to be to the client. There is no right answer. One can argue
either way.
If the threat is seen as high, the likely recommendation is for your client to begin
supplying private label products. The candidate should recognize that in competing in the
private label segment, the basis of competition is primarily cost. At the same time, the
client’s branded product should be protected. The following tactics might prove
appropriate:
• Seek to wring costs out of all phases of the operation
• Utilize all existing excess capacity
• Gain maximum product knowledge as quickly as possible
• Understand low cost positions on product ingredients and mix
• Review process improvement/ manufacturing efficiency opportunities
• Undertake overhead reduction efforts (Any of these points could be discussed in great
detail)
• Ensure there is no customer confusion between private label offering and branded
product
• Seek partnering agreements with retailers
• Joint advertising and promotions
• Explore deals with mass merchandisers to enter private labels (remember, mass
merchandisers presently sell no private label)
If the threat is seen as low, the likely recommendation is for your client to stay with
branded cookies only. The candidate should recognize that in competing in the branded
segment the basis of competition is one of differentiation. Additionally, your client
should do all it can to halt or reverse the momentum of the private label segment. The
following tactics might prove useful:
• Pursue a maximum differentiation strategy
• Invest in brand image to support premium price
• Make it difficult to copy product: innovate wisely through product advances, smart
product line extensions, frequent changes to the product
• Manage price gap: explore price increases where appropriate (Again, any of these
points could be discussed in great detail)
• Explore exclusive partnering with mass merchandisers
• Consider alternative distribution channels
• Seek partnering agreements with grocers regarding branded products
• Educate grocers as available
• Customers who buy private labels are the most price sensitive. They also tend to be
the least loyal customers and spend less per store visit.
• Grocers’ financial stake in private label products extends beyond the product margins.
There is lost profit from branded products that could occupy the same shelf space,
advertising costs of the private label products, etc.
Key Takeaways:
This case has no right or wrong answer. It forces the candidate to take a stand in a “grey”
situation and defend it. It also provides a large amount of data upfront which the
candidate must quickly sort through and determine what is important and what is not. The
key is to understand the story behind the data. How did the private label segment emerge?
What is driving it? How has it affected manufacturers, retailers and consumers?"
"Problem:
Your client is a German owned water utility that is headquartered in the Northeast United
States. The water utility serves the majority of the northeast area and is the exclusive
provider or water in the region. Internally, the client measures its performance using a
version of the EVA (economic value added) financial valuation technique. This
technique emphasizes the corporate return as a function of profits and a capital charge
(essentially the return that capital assets produce). The EVA function can be written as:

EVA = Net Operating Profits – (WACC*Capital Asset Base); which essentially is “un-
levered” operating income (after tax) less the fair return on invested capital.

Currently the client is operating at a negative EVA level. How would you go about
getting EVA to the value of zero and eventually turning it positive? What are the various
ideas you would explore:","Solution:
When I first got this case, I was only vaguely familiar with EVA based on some work in
corporate finance, and I made sure to ask a couple of questions about the formula to
ensure I understood it. It was not critical to the case to be an EVA expert, but you needed
to understand what the equation was saying. The key part was recognizing that the
weight of the equation resides with the first term (meaning Operating Profits have a
larger effect on EVA because the other component of the equation is the WACC (a
percentage figure multiplied by the capital assets of the firm). A candidate should come
to this conclusion on his/her own. If not, then the interviewer should point it out if the
candidate struggles.
Once you understand that Operating Profits drive a large portion of EVA, you need to
explore what effects operating profits, but don’t completely ignore the capital asset base
as you want to be comprehensive in your analysis. A good place to start would be
exploring top line revenue implications, and then to explore the cost elements (or vice
versa). The candidate should also explore what assets are driving the capital asset base.
Lastly, a solid candidate cannot ignore regulatory issues in this case, and should mention
them in the course of the discussion.
The case had no real answer per say, but was more about exhaustively testing ideas. A
good interviewer should be creative in challenging the candidate to go in multiple
directions beyond the information provided below.
Information To Be Provided If Requested:
• Revenues have been relatively flat over the past 12 to 18 months. Majority of
revenue comes from residential and commercial water usage (billed on a
consumption basis per month)
• Pricing is based on usage, and is not really capable of being altered significantly
due to regulations
• There have not been significant changes to the capital base, which is primarily
made up of machinery and equipment for water filtration and delivery
• Costs have been relatively stable on the whole.
• The water utility has the capacity to serve more customers
Essentially, what you have is a situation where the company needs to grow to increase its
revenue base. An ability to add additional customers would be a good idea, as the
company effectively has additional capacity. The candidate should explore potential
growth scenarios and should rebound when he/she hits a dead end. Some potential
growth ideas might include:
• What about providing bottled water (e.g. a different channel?)
o Good idea, but likely difficult to implement without incurring additional
costs for distribution, packaging, branding, etc

• What about expanding into other regions?
o Possible barriers could be regulatory concerns and other competitors
o Past history dictates local people and businesses are not supportive of
expansion by this company
 Candidate should ask why?
 Recall it is a German company, and there has been a bit of resentment
on the socio-political front for this company to expand based on its
history of acquiring other local US companies in the past.
• Based on past history, merging with another entity and dropping the German
name might be a good idea"
"Problem:
Our client is a major airline company and the CEO contacts you (a BCG partner) and said
that he wanted to put one more passenger on each of his company’s flights. We will go to
a meeting with him now and we need to prepare two things:
• The financial return of one more passenger per flight. Is it worthwhile to do so?
• The marketing strategy to attract these new passengers.","Solution:
First element of the solution: The financial return
To calculate the financial return, the candidate should look that the revenue and cost side
of bringing one more passenger per flight.
One the revenue side, we need:
• Average cost of a ticket;
• Number of new passengers.
The candidate should also briefly ask about if he can assume that there is enough capacity
to put one more passenger onboard.
Second element of the solution: The average cost of a ticket
The candidate should ask about the kind of routes, the market share, and then price of
each of them.
In this case, we were talking about the Brazilian market and this airline has only domestic
flights. The interviewer simplified the numbers a lot the make the calculations easier.
You should adapt the numbers to US domestic airline market or any other you would
like. For Brazil, the interviewer gave the following information:
• 60% of the flights are between two major cities (Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro),
which are 45 minutes apart and the ticket costs US$100.00;
• 20% between other major capitals which are 1 hour and a half apart from each
other and the ticket also costs US100.00;
• 20% between other cities which are 3 hours apart and cost US$ 300.00.
So the average ticket price is: (80% * 100 + 20% * 300) / 100 = $ 140.00
Third Element of Solution: Number of new passengers
There are several ways to come up with the number of new passengers. I proposed two:
1. Calculate the number of flights: estimate the number of airplanes that the
company owns and then estimate the number of flights each airplane does.
2. Calculate the number of cities (average) in which the company makes flights
and the average number of flights per city.

The interviewer said that I should use the first approach since he had looked at the
company’s website and he found out that they have 100 airplanes.
I asked if I could assume that 80% of the planes were used for the 1 hour flights and 20%
for 3 hour flights. He answered that this was not 100% true in practice because depending
on the city, we could have more frequent flights than others, but he agreed that I could do
this approximation. The interviewee can come up with other reasonable assumptions.
The candidate should also notice that normally the company spends a lot of money and
time performing maintenance on its airplanes. If the candidate forgets to mention this and
starts using all 110 airplanes, you should ask what assumptions he made to use the all the
planes at once. For this company, the interviewer mentioned that this company had a little
less than 10% of its airplane in maintenance.
So, assuming 100 airplanes available, we have:
• 100 × 80% = 80 airplanes doing 1 hour flights
• 100 × 20% = 20 airplanes doing 3 hours flights
To estimate the number of flights per airplane per day, we need the range of hours of
flights during a day and the interval of time in which an airplane stays on the ground.
What the interviewer wants to hear is not the right number, but what are your
assumptions to get to the numbers, for example:
Fourth Element of Solution: Flight time
• The first airplane departs at 6:00 am because the executives must arrive at its
client’s at 8:00 am, for example.
• There will be no flights after 10:00 pm, so we will assume that the last flight will
arrive at midnight.
So, there is no flight between midnight and 6:00 am.
Fifth Element of Solution: On the ground time:
• Taxing – 10 minutes
• Passengers going out – 15 minutes
• Cleaning / food supply – 10 minutes
• Passenger going in – 15 minutes
• Taxing – 10 minutes
Total: 60 minutes  1 hour.
Therefore, based on the above we have:
• 18h / 2h = 9 short flights per day
• 18/h / 4h ~ 4 long flights per day
• 80 × 9 short flights per day = 720 flights
• 20 × 4 long flights per day = 80 flight
• Total = 800 flights per day
So, the extra revenue in one month is 800 flights / day * 30 days * $140 = $ 3,360,000
On the cost side, the candidate should realize that the cost of one extra passenger is only
the marginal cost, which can be ignored. Therefore, the extra profit is the extra revenue.
The interviewer asked why was it important to have this row estimation about the extra
profit before going to meet the client. I said that it was important to have a sense of the
size of the clients’ issue and the interviewer agreed."
"Problem:
A military aircraft client is worried that their stock price is falling. How would you go
about investigating the cause of the decline and help them improve their share price.","Suggested Approach:
Recognize that share price is based on expectations of future profits. This insight will
lead directly to a profitability (revenue/cost) framework. You should mention both the
revenue side and the cost side as potential reasons why profits (and share price) might be
falling. Good questions to hone in on a particular area are: Have prices been falling? Has
the client been selling fewer planes? Have component costs risen? Have there been
significant capital expenditures or maintenance expenditures? There are many similar
questions one could ask
The interviewer should mention that the military aircraft industry has been contracting
due to cutbacks in military spending. This environment would limit prospects for
improving revenue and focus discussion on costs.
There are a variety of ways to cut costs: cutting fixed costs by closing plants, automating
more of the operation, using more common parts among plane models, managing
inventory better, training operators to be more efficient. The main point here is to think
broadly. Remember that costs are not only a function of the materials and equipment, but
also of the work practices, available technology, and skill of the workers.
In this particular case, the recommendation to the client was to try to merge with a
weaker player to realize some economies of scale. When told that there were five players
in the market, it was easy to see that not all would survive a market contraction. The
client acquired a smaller player and six months after the acquisition, the share price
started rising again."
"Problem:
A fast food chain was experiencing rapid growth. They had acquired several new
locations and reapplied their business model in those new stores. They were disappointed
that some of the stores seemed to do well, while others were barely breaking even. How
would you go about investigating this problem?
Information to be divulged if asked:
• The firm's older stores were in predominantly lower income neighborhoods.
• The underperforming stores were actually selling more product per customer, but
were attracting far fewer customers.","Suggested Approach:
First try to understand the specific nature of the problem at the poor performing stores.
Specifically, compared with other stores are revenues lower or costs higher?
Revenue
• Fewer customers
• Lower sales per customer (i.e. less or cheaper food purchased)
Costs
• Labor
• Real estate and facilities
• Food inputs and other variable costs
Then focus on why the new stores are attracting fewer customers.
Price: Are prices too high? Too low?
Customers
• How are they segmented?
• Are the different stores serving different segments?
• What are the demands of the different segments?
Location
• Where are the old/new stores located? Part of town? In malls, drive-thrus or
freestanding shops?
Product
• Do the stores all serve the same food?
• Are different products selling better in the new/old stores?
Competition: Is the firm facing the same competitors in both locations?
Analysis should reveal that location as a key
The firm's old stores were in predominantly low-income areas where the firm faced few
competitors. The new stores were primarily in upscale malls where the firm faced more
competition and suffered from its image as a low-price brand.
This ultimately was the reason"
"Problem:
A few years ago, the Channel Tunnel opened connecting Britain and France by train. The
airlines covering the London to Paris route then faced a competitive threat from a train
service covering the same route. How should the airlines have reacted to this threat,
specifically the threat to business passengers who had been their most lucrative market?
How would you see the competitive situation sorting itself out —specifically, would
trains or planes win or will there continue to be a market for both?","Suggested Approach:
A good answer will cover the following points:
• Service differentiation
o Time taken overall from point to point
o Comfort at any stage from point to point
o Frequency of planes/trains
• Convenience (ease of reaching stations/airports, boarding, etc.)
o Ease of working on board
o Customer segmentation: e.g., commuters, transit passengers from other routes
• Price
o Price sensitivity of business travelers
o Price advantage/premium of one form over the other
• Cost structure of both industries
o Both industries have high fixed costs
o Implication of a price/fare war
• Capacity/operations
o Change in capacity
o Relative capacity
o Ease of changing capacity (i.e. different size planes)
• A strong answer might also include one or more of the following:
o Changes in the regulatory structure in Europe and effects the rail and airline
industries
o How individual airlines might react based on fare structure, route system,
financial situation or size.
o How the relative mix of leisure and business passengers (and the ease with which
that mix can be changed) might effect competition.
o Game theory and/or macroeconomic discussion
o Effects of passenger loyalty
o Effect of possible future events (air or tram. accident, changes in. fuel prices)
o Changes in business purchasing habits"
"Problem:
Consider a law firm. They hire in associates right out of law school at $100,000 a year. Is
this a good deal?","Suggested Approach:
This is a good case for a basic profit = revenue - costs analysis.
First, step through marginal revenue associated with adding a new lawyer. Start simple -
does the firm have work for the new lawyers to do? Assuming the answer is “yes,” then
assume an hourly rate for the new associate's work, the number of hours billed per day
and the number of days worked per year to get an estimated revenue figure for the year.
Now look at additional costs. In addition to salary, you should estimate taxes, overhead,
training and benefits and any other expenses you can think of. Don't forget recruiting
costs (amortize these over the average gm. e a new associate will stay with the firm.)
Once you have this basic framework, it can be expanded with other details (time
permitting.) Other possible factors include the quality of lawyers you get for $100K (is
this above or below market?), the need to give raises in subsequent years, the option of
hiring experienced lawyers or cheaper legal assistants instead, etc...."
"MACHINE LOADING
Background
A client produces a range of synthetic materials in varying widths and lengths. Each
material is used for packaging but each differs with respect to physical properties
such as weight, flexibility, general performance and cost. Each material can be
coated with any one of four or five types of chemical substance that make the
materials more or less impervious to heat, light, water, vapor, etc.
Question
The client wonders which combination of products he should manufacture to
increase his plant's profitability. How would you go about determining the optimal
mix of materials that he should produce?
Additional Information
Products
Our client's machinery can produce hundreds of different products. Some have been
uniquely designed to meet specific customer requirements while others are used by
a wide variety of customers.
Customers
Our client's customers are primarily consumers or industrial products manufacturers
who use synthetic materials in packaging their own products.
Market Share
The industry is highly fragmented. Numerous small manufacturers supply similar
products to a wide range of customers. Our client estimates he has less than 1
percent of the total market. No competitor has more than 3 percent of the total
market.
Cost
The cost to manufacture each product varies according to materials used and the
manufacturing process.
Price
Each product has a different price dependent on the cost to manufacture as well as
the market for the product.
Suppliers
Our client uses commodity products primarily in the manufacturing process. All
materials can be obtained from a number of sources.","Approaches
The primary issue in the case is determining the product mix that ensures that the
profit of the plant will be maximized. The candidate should discuss the following for
each product in order to gauge profitability: fixed and variable manufacturing costs,
selling costs, and prices. The interviewee should also address the market demandfor each product (to ensure that what is produced can be sold at an acceptable
price).
If the candidate discusses issues that are not relevant to the profitability of each
product line or to maximizing the profitability of the plant overall, repeat the question
and ask how the issue being discussed will lead to a solution for the client.
Minimum Requirements
The candidate should, at a minimum, address the following issues:
1. Are there market limitations to the potential production of any one material?
2. Is there competition for these products?
3. Are there cost differences in the manufacturing of these materials? For
example, do some coatings cost more than others? Do some materials have
inherent cost differences?
4. Is there flexibility in the pricing of these products?
Better Answers
Additional questions and observations should include:
1. Are there differences in setup times and costs for various materials or
coatings?
2. Do these materials move at different speeds through the machines?
3. Are the machines truly interchangeable, or are some better suited to one
product or another?
4. Is there an unlimited market demand for these products?
5. Are there technological displacement or replacement products on the
horizon?
Outstanding Answers
The best candidates will formulate a profit maximization algorithm. The superior
algorithm would maximize the profit contribution per machine hour.
1. The formulation would be: Profit contribution (unit volume) times (unit price minus
unit variable cost).
2. Machine-hour capacity is a surrogate for fixed costs per unit of volume. Fixed
costs take into account depreciation and standby costs as well as those costs
that are independent of the variable costs per pound or ton of material produced.
An outstanding answer would include recognition of asset costs and required capital
as well as the income or profit contribution. Also, potential substantial differences in
volume produced per machine-hour and/or the price obtainable in the marketplace
relative to the cost must be weighed. Finally, consideration must be given to
potential market demand and competitive actions."
"STEAM BOILER HOSES
Background
A consulting firm was asked by a diversified manufacturing client to help turn around
the firm’s steam boiler hose division. This division provides boiler hoses for both
external customers and the client's boiler division. Background information on the
client and industry follows:

• Boiler hoses are sold with original equipment and as replacements on
older equipment.
• There has been increasing price pressure in the industry.
• The client is third largest of eight industry participants.

Question
How would you structure an analysis aimed at restoring profitability? Where do you
expect to save costs?
Additional Information

• Last year P&L showed (as a percent of sales):

Raw Material 70%
Labor 20%
Distributed Overhead 10%
SG&A 15%
Profit (15%)

• Raw material is a commodity petrochemical.
• At least two of the other companies in the industry are making
moderate profits.","Approaches
Minimum Requirements
The candidate should avoid getting bogged down in the following areas:
1. Drop the product line (apparently not possible because hoses are necessary
for boiler operations).
2. Raw material prices (they are the same as every other firm’s).
3. Allocation of overhead (no savings available; little potential).
4. SG&A (standard industry fee paid for independent installers).
Better Answers
Better answers will consider:
1. Economies of Scale (client is big enough to achieve scale production).
2. Production technology (client has modern plant).
3. Labor costs (wage rate and productivity are average for industry).

4. Raw material purchasing practices (materials are purchased through long-
term contracts based on the spot market price minus a discount).
Outstanding Answers
The best answers, following a logical progression, should discover the actual
answer: the product has been over-designed, requiring excess raw material. The
superior answer should consider the following organizational implications:
1. How is the product engineering operation wired into the marketplace? (There
is little contact between the engineering and marketing/sales organizations.)
2. What kind of feedback are we receiving from our sales force? (Customers are
delighted with the hoses, but don't require all product features.)
3. Are there other areas in the company where similar problems exist?"
"PLASTIC MOLDING MANUFACTURER
Background
Over the past seven years a plastic molding manufacturer has experienced declining
profitability.
Question
What should the company do to return the company to profitability?
Additional Information
Product
The company has two primary product lines: custom and non-custom. Revenue is
roughly split between the two product lines.

• The non-custom line makes plastic containers to hold food products
such as salsa, etc. The containers come in a few different varieties,
but each variety is standard.
• The custom line creates plastic molds for products such as TV
dinners for which the mold must be customized.
The products across competitors are fairly homogeneous.
Customers
The customer base is fragmented and consists primarily of food companies. There
are no apparent ways to segment the customer base. Some purchase only one
product line while other buy from both product segments.
Industry
The industry is fragmented and comprises many competitors. The products they
manufacture are relatively homogeneous. The client believes that many of its
competitors are not experiencing their own decline in profitability. As a whole, the
industry is relatively mature, basically growing along with GNP.
Financial

• Operating margins are positive for both product lines (approximately 5
and 6 percent for custom and non-custom respectively).
• Overall margins are negative for both (approximately -2 and -1
percent for custom and non-custom respectively).
• Over the past few years, profitability has been slowly changing (i.e.,
no sudden event has been the cause).
• Fixed costs for the company are primarily made up of sales,
machinery, and administration.
• Variable costs are composed of raw material and labor. Raw
materials are commodities. Labor is primarily hourly and unionized
(and typical for the area and skill being provided).
• The manufacturing process currently is predominantly manual and
has no real potential to become more automated.
• The machinery is 10 years old and will last another 15.
• Sales and administrative costs will remain relatively unaffected (and
are very difficult to reduce) as volume increases (hence they are
included among fixed costs).","Approach

A profitability framework may work best here. Focus on the equation Profit = (Price-
Cost)*Quantity - Fixed Cost. Some of the key points to emphasize:

• Price: The large number of competitors manufacturing the
homogeneous product make it unlikely that any of them could raise
price without losing substantial volume.
• Variable Cost: Since the raw materials are commodities, there is little
or no opportunity to decrease cost. Labor shows little opportunity for
having its cost decreased.
• Quantity: Since operating margins are positive but overall margins
are negative, the overall margins could become positive if volume
were to be increased. Such an increase would allow the company to
cover fixed costs more efficiently. The candidate should focus on
ways to increase volume:
• What is the market growth rate?
• What is the market share of the client and how can it capture more?
• Fixed Costs: There is not much opportunity to reduce fixed costs."
"SKI RESORT
Background and Question
A regional association of ski resorts, SKIASSOC, wishes to increase its members’
profits. How can the association do this?
Additional Information
• SKIASSOC has 15-20 members.
• All SKIASSOC members are located in the state of Colorado.
• More than 90 percent of the ski resorts in Colorado are members.","Approach
SKIASSOC member ski resorts must either increase revenues or decrease costs. A
profit tree is useful in determining the opportunities.

P increase average ticket price by setting up joint tickets or rules regarding pricing/discounts
R
V increase the number of tickets sold by setting up joint marketing programs to bring people
into the area. Use joint budget to leverage member resort’s marketing spend.
$

C joint efforts in marketing/promotion could reduce costs while increasing awareness; joint
owership of infrequently used or underutilized equipment could also reduce costs

Although SKIASSOC could set up effective price floors and joint marketing programs,
it must remain conscious of antitrust concerns and competition from outside the
region. If Colorado becomes too expensive, customers will go elsewhere or even
choose not to ski at all. It is also important to keep in mind that there are two
markets being served: local skiers and inbound travelers. Price discrimination could
be effectively utilized to extract more revenue."
"INDUSTRIAL WIDGETS
Background
IndustroCo makes and sells 300 different types of industrial widgets. Profits have
been declining over the last several years.
Question
IndustroCo has hired your firm to analyze why profits have been declining and to
recommend solutions to reverse this trend.
Additional Information
• IndustroCo has developed many innovative products over the years, but is
best known for its first product.

• The company has two distribution channels: a company-operated, catalog-
based 800 line; and a direct sales force for large companies.

IndustroCo has been losing money on over 100 of its products.
• Most of these products are sold to small to mid size OEM’s and have a small
average order size.
• Production costs on these items are much higher than the sales to large
customers since changeover / equipment retooling costs are high relative to
the number of units produced.","Approach
Use 3C/4P analyses to probe for more information. Here are a few good questions:
• Do the products fit into any segments or buckets?
• How many products are profitable and how many are losing money?
• How are costs allocated among products?
• How accurate are the cost-accounting systems?
• Have any Activity Based Costing analyses been done?
• Are historical data available from the accounting systems?
• Are there any transfer pricing issues?
Possible solutions include higher minimum-order quantities, fewer fulfillment dates
per year, higher inventories, and/or product repricing to reflect actual costs incurred."
"RAIL FREIGHT HAULER
Background
The client is the CEO of a larger company that is currently engaged in the business
of Rail Freight Hauling. The business fundamentals continue to be strong, but
recently the Company has struggled in generating the strong shareholder return that
is characteristic of the Company and its peer group.
Question
What has caused the decline in shareholder return and how should the CEO address
the problem?
Additional Information
• The industry is very mature.
• Companies in industry tend to generate a lot of cash – once significant fixed
costs are incurred, business has relatively low variable costs (fuel is the major
one, but this can’t be major cause of the problem because it affects entire
industry).
• There are four major companies in industry – two in the West and two in the
East.
• All competitors have roughly the same national market share.
• The small number of total competitors is due to significant consolidation in
industry.
• Service is non-contiguous between the East and West and transnational service
is a small segment of the overall market
• Our client competes only in the West and in this segment, 75% of revenue is
served by our client and the competitor (equal market share). Of the remaining
25% (mainly coal and agriculture), 10% is served by our client and 15% is served
by the competitor. Revenue growth generally comes from acquisition – typically
market shares remain relatively constant (nobody steals too much market share).
• Segments served are the following: Coal (35%), Agriculture (15%), Chemical
(10%), Merchandise (25%), Auto (5%), and Intermodal Trailer Rigs (10%).
• Company is one of more profitable in industry. They have been able to generate
cost savings of approximately 10% per year for the last five years.
• Our client recently (10 months ago) merged with another company of equal size
– our client has completed 75% of the integration of the merged companies,
areas which include stock yards, service centers, train sets, and track disposition","Approach
The key to this case is not getting caught up in all of the industry information that
comes up throughout the case. Because this is such a mature industry, the
candidate should realize that profit improvement opportunities are only going to
come from acquisitions (to generate top-line growth) or cost cutting. Once it is
determined that the Company made a significant acquisition, the candidate should walk through integration issues. The candidate should eventually recognize that the
merger has left considerable assets under-utilized. Significant assets could be sold
off, and in particular, much of the track accumulated in the merger could be sold to
mom and pop short distance railways (e.g. scenic tours, specialized hauling)."
"MAP AND GLOBE MANUFACTURER
Background
High-quality, large-format maps constitute about 3 percent of total map market
demand. The vast majority of maps are low-cost, foldable items used mostly by
automobile drivers. The globe market, however, is about 95 percent geared toward
high-quality, educational oriented products. Almost all domestic globe manufactures
also make educational quality maps.
Question
MapCo, a mid-sized manufacturer of maps and globes for schools, is losing market
share and would like to increase profits. How can it do so?
Additional Information

• There are five competitors in this marketplace.
• MapCo is the third largest.
• The largest player has a 30 percent market share.","Approach
Use 3C/4P analyses to better understand the market.

• The sales model is to make as frequent contact with schools as is
cost-effective.
• The items the client is selling are not a major consideration for school
principals, so being in the right place at the right time is critical.
• Schools are NOT price-sensitive to these items because they don't
replace many of them, and the principals don't want to spend any time
or effort in shopping around.

A possible solution to the client’s problems is to raise prices and increase the
number of sales visits to schools. Provide the sales force with an incentive by making
compensation more commission-based (currently 95 percent from salary)."
"AUSTRALIAN AIRLINE
Background
The client is an Australian airline that serves greater Australia and operates two
major business units: a commercial passenger commuter service and a package
delivery service within Australia. This case specifically focuses on the client’s
package delivery service. The client currently has the largest market share of air
freight, but its business base and profitability are both eroding.
Question
Identify and discuss relevant issues in determining why the client is experiencing
these problems, and develop a performance enhancement plan. If time permits
explain the plan.
Additional Information
Air Freight Market:
• Growth: declining over last five years.
• Market share: 53 percent for client, down from 60 percent one year ago.
• No major competitor, small air freight delivery makes up rest of market.
Delivery Freight Market (only give if requested):
• Growth: increasing by 5-7 percent over last five years.
• Made up of air, ground, and rail segments.
• Client has 17 percent of delivery market, down from 30 percent one year ago,
60 percent five years ago.
Customer Base:
• Australian market: five cities within 400 miles of each other accounting for 80
percent of business.
• Professional and personal - mostly small packages (under 5 pounds).
• 80/20 rule: 20 percent of customers account for 80 percent of business
• Medium/large companies are major users of delivery services.
Competition:
• Trucking companies now dominate delivery market: 20 percent five years
ago, 40 percent two years ago, 60 percent today.
• Truck delivery companies service the five-city radius.
• Schedule: 5PM package drop-off (no pick-up); arrival within two or three
business days.
• Prices comparable for similar service.
Company:
• Fleet of 35 commercial jets traveling once or twice daily to each major city in
Australia.
• Packages placed in cargo holds of plane (negligible incremental costs -
additional loading time).
• 35 planes operate at 100 percent capacity.
• Two freight planes carry packages overnight (fully owned by client).
• Freight planes operate at 65 percent capacity.
Distribution:
• No efficient system - packages organized by destination and sit on dock until
loaded on plane.
• Because of two or three day delivery schedule promised to customers,
packages can sit on dock overnight or for a few days before being shipped.
Cost/price Analysis (only give as requested):

Client Truck(avg. competitor)
Price $10 (under 5 lbs) $10 (under 5 lbs)
Service 2-3 day delivery 2-3 day delivery
Cargo space/day 10,000 sq. ft 4,000 sq. ft
Package Size 5 pkgs./sq. ft 5 pkgs./sq. ft
VC/day $250,000 $150,000","Approach
• All areas above should be examined for minimal answer.
• Candidate should recognize that the major competitors are truck companies.
• Recommendations should concern enhancements in client’s distribution
system.
• Client could also lower prices as a result of higher capacity and lower costs.
• Very Good Answer: Client is an air freighter whose major competitive
advantage is efficiency over its competition (truck service). Client should
promote fast delivery times and overnight or same-day service.
• Another Good Suggestion: Partner with an international company and handle
domestic distribution.
• Bad Answer: Buy trucks and begin ground transport delivery service."
"ITALIAN RESTAURANT
Background
A friend of yours owns an Italian restaurant in Lincoln Park. Historically it has been a
successful restaurant. Recently, profits have dropped.
Question
Why are profits dropping?
Additional Information

• The restaurant could be characterized as a mid-priced “Italian Grill”,
similar to Bella Vista or Mia Francesca. It is a tried and proven
restaurant concept in the Chicago area.
• Revenue has fallen, while costs have remained steady or have fallen
slightly.
• There have been no changes in competitors or competitive behavior.
• There have been no changes in overall customer preferences, or
customer incomes.
• There are three types of entrees served at the restaurant: pasta, fillets
and seafood.
• Recently, the restaurant has been serving more pasta and less of the
other entrees.
• Pasta entrees are lower margin than the other types of entrees.
• The same numbers of customers come through the restaurant in a
given night.
• There have been no major changes is unit costs (i.e. the cost of
products or labor have not changed significantly).","Approach
• The key to this case is to take a structured look at what drives the restaurant
profitability. Intuitively, the candidate should have an understanding that there
are two main product categories in a restaurant: alcohol and food.
• The candidate should also realize that there are several drivers of overall
revenue: The amount of time spent in the restaurant significantly drives spending
on alcohol.
• The candidate should develop the intuition that the costs of the three types of
entrees differ. Pasta is much cheaper, and therefore has lower margins than the
other entrees.
• A key point to the case is to realize that while overall customer preferences of the
market as a whole have not changed, but the restaurant is attracting more of the
pasta segment of the market.
• The candidate should realize that if the same number of customers come through
the restaurant in a given night, then per customer spending must have dropped.
• The candidate should also realize that if the same number of customers come
through the restaurant in less time, each customer on average spends less time
in the restaurant - this impacts sales of alcohol.
• Ultimately, the analysis should identify two main issues driving profitability.
Plausible explanations of the two issues are included so the interviewer can
develop an interesting story.

1. Tables are being turned quicker. Previously, table turnover was much
slower, which forced many people to wait in the bar and consume
relatively high priced drinks.
2. The mix of customers has changed. More young couples are attending
the restaurant, and are ordering more pasta at the expense of the higher
priced entrees."
"BUSINESS SCHOOL COFFEE SHOP
Background
A business school coffee shop has traditionally been profitable. Lately, profits have
dropped.
Question
Why is the coffee shop losing money?
Additional Information
• The coffee shop sells two types of products: coffee and quick snacks (e.g.
individually wrapped, ready to eat food).
• Product offerings have remained the same.
• Unit costs have remained constant.
• Fixed costs have remained the same.
• Revenue has increased
• Sales of Coffee, in units, have remained constant.
• Sales of Quick Snacks, in units, have increased.
• In percentage terms, Coffee used to comprise 90% of sales (it now comprises
60%), and Quick Snacks used to comprise 10% of sales (and now comprise
40% of sales)
• A nearby campus cafeteria has recently closed down
• The margin on a cup of Coffee is 20 cents, while the margin on a Quick
Snack is -2 cents.","Approach
• The central issue in this case is the sales mix of the store.
• The candidate should figure out that an increase in Quick Snacks coupled with
constant Coffee sales means that Quick Snacks represent a proportionately
higher percentage of total sales.
• The candidate should also investigate the relative margins on each type of
product.
• The candidate should go beyond the sales mix change and be able to address
the big picture: With the closing of the cafeteria, the coffee shop has picked up
some of the demand for food."

Background
The client is a cookie manufacturer. They have experienced a recent decline in
market share and profitability.
Question
What is the problem? What recommendation(s) do you have to address the
declining profitability?
Additional Information
• Unit sales have declined
• Prices have increased from $1.20 last year to $1.25 this year
• The following variable costs have increased:
- Cost of materials has gone from $.50 last year to $.55 this year
- Manufacturing Overhead has increased from $.15 a bag last year to $.20
this year
• The following variable cost has remained constant:
- SG&A has stayed at $.10
• The following variable cost has decreased:
- Labor has gone from $.15 last year to $.10 this year.
• Distribution cost has remained constant
• The market is mature
• There have been no new competitors or products to enter the market in this
time period
• Industry sales have been unchanged (thus market share for the client has
dropped since their sales have declined)","Approach
1. The candidate should immediately divide the case into revenues and costs.
Also, including a third bucket such as industry dynamics will allow the candidate
to explore industry trends.
2. Questions regarding industry trends should extract the following information:
− The market is mature
− Their have been no new products or competitors to enter the market
− Industry sales have remained constant
These questions should lead the candidate to the conclusion that the problem
lies within the company
3. Questions regarding revenues should extract the following information:
- Unit sales have been declining
- Prices have been increasing
- Decline in sales offsets the increase in price in terms of average revenue
The candidate should conclude that revenue is not the cause for the decline
in profitability
4. To determine if costs are the problem, the candidate should ask questions
regarding variable costs versus fixed costs. Questions about variable costs
should extract the following information:
- Cost of material has increased
- Labor has decreased
- Manufacturing overhead has increased
- SG&A has remained constant
- Distribution routes and distribution costs have remained constant
- There are no other relevant variable costs
The fact that labor costs is the only one to decrease should clue the
candidate that automation is part of the issue. Overall, variable costs have
increased which is the source of the declining profitability.
5. Questions regarding fixed costs should reveal:
- Fixed costs have increased
6. The candidate should surmise at this point that new machinery which automates
labor has been purchased. The fact that the cost of material has increased
should indicate to the candidate that either the size of the cookie or the amount
of cookies in a bag has increased. This is the answer to the problem: Last year,
a new cookie machine was purchased that bakes, bags, and seals the cookies.
Previously, this was done manually. However, the new machine is placing more
cookies in a bag than did the previous method, and costs have increased.
7. The recommendation should be to advertise that there are now more cookies in
each bag and raise the price of the product. The fact that there are more cookies
per bag was not realized previously; thus the price for cookies was not increased,
and profitability declined."
"GOURMET CHOCLATE MANUFACTURER
Background
The client is a manufacturer of gourmet chocolates. They produce both custom
designed chocolates, as well as commodity baking chocolates. They are known for
their excellent service, which allows them to charge a price premium. Recently, their
costs have decreased, their unit sales have increased, but their profit margin has
decreased.
Question
Why has their profit margin decreased if their costs have decreased and unit sales
has increased?
Additional Information:
• Profit margin was 10% 3 years ago; now it is 4%
• They have maintained their market share
• 95% of their volume sales is commodity chocolate, 5% is custom-designed
chocolate
• They have the same type of customers as always: large candy stores (i.e. sales
to large department stores), small candy stores (i.e. pharmacies or small candy
stores), catalog sales (i.e. sales directly to end-customer)
• The proportion of their sales today is 15% to large candy stores, 80% to small
candy stores, and 5% to catalogs.
• (Note: The following points are the key to answering the case and should
only be provided if the candidate asks for this information)
• The proportion of their sales 2 years ago was 5% to large candy stores, 90% to
small candy stores, and 5% to catalogs. Profit margin for large candy stores is
lower than that of small candy stores
• Prices have declined
• Costs have basically been unchanged","Approach:
• The candidate should recognize this is a profitability question and should divide
the case into revenues and costs. An outstanding approach will include adding
a third bucket which is customers (who are the client’s customers and is there a
difference in revenues and costs depending on customer type)
• Good questioning concerning costs will involve dividing costs into fixed and
variable costs. Questions on costs should extract the following information:
- There has been no change with fixed or variable costs
The candidate should then quickly realize that cost is not the issue
• Questions on revenue should extract the following information:
- Average price has declined
- The volume sales breakdown has changed with increased sales towards
large candy stores and decreased sales towards small candy stores
• With this information, the candidate’s answer should be that the reason for the
declining profitability, despite increased unit sales and decreased costs, is that
the profit margin for large candy stores is less, since large stores can extract more volume discounts, and with a higher proportion of the client’s sales going to
large candy stores, the client’s profit margin has thus decreased"
"RETAIL STORE
Background
A consulting firm was hired by a well-known manufacturer of designer men’s and
women’s clothing. A few years ago, the client decided to open a new distribution
channel – their own retail store. They opened one store in New York City, which
quickly became very profitable and successful. They then decided to open 3 new
stores in Chicago, Boston, and Dallas, respectively. After 5 years, they found that
the Boston store was not as profitable as the one in New York City.
Question
Why is the Boston store less profitable? How would you go about assessing the
source of the problem?
Additional Information
• Both stores are in very good shopping locations
• The stores are the same size
• In terms of fixed costs, they are about the same although the lease for the New
York store is slightly higher
• In terms of variable costs, labor, inventory, electricity, overhead, and taxes are all
the same
• They sell different merchandise. The New York store sells more upscale
clothing, i.e. suits, based on the local demand. The Boston store sells more
weekend or casual wear , i.e. sweaters, khakis (Note: This is key to answering
the case and should only be provided if the candidate asks for this information.).
• The profit margin on the upscale clothing is higher than on weekend or casual
wear (Note: This is key to answering the case and should only be provided if the
candidate asks for this information.).","Approach
• The candidate should divide the case into Revenues and Costs, by store. A third
bucket that would demonstrate logical thinking is Competition although this ends
up having no relevance to the answer in this case
• Questions regarding costs should be split into fixed versus variable costs. The
following information should be extracted:
- Fixed costs are about the same, although the lease in New York is slightly
higher
- Variable costs for operating the store are the same
The candidate should conclude that costs are not the issue.
• Questions regarding competition should extract the following information:
- Competition is similar in both New York and Boston, since both stores are
located in upscale shopping areas 
The candidate should conclude that competition is not the issue
• Questions regarding revenue should be asked for both New York and Boston.
The following information should be extracted:
- The merchandise sold in New York versus Boston is different
- The merchandise sold in New York extracts a higher price. The profit margin
is higher.
• With this approach, the candidate should conclude that the more upscale product
mix, the selection of which is driven by local demand, drives higher profitability in
the New York store. Therefore, a difference in profitability is to be expected."
"METAL HEAD AUTOMOTIVE PARTS
Background
A consulting firm was hired by the CEO of a conglomerate. All divisions of this
conglomerate must have a 20% ROI. One division, Metal Head Auto Parts, has had
slowly declining profitability for the last seven years, and now has an ROI below
20%.
Question
What is the cause of the decline, and what are the options?
Additional Information
• The company makes several products which are made of lead and tin alloys:
- Stamped metal products (15%)
- Fuel filler hoses for cars (85%)
• The old CEO is nearing retirement.
• Market entry is very difficult because of environmental restrictions on lead and tin
manufacturing
• Metal Head has 44% of the market, the other two competitors have 50%
• The overall market has declined by 20% since 1986. Sales to the Big-3 have
declined even more, but the transplants are now about 10% of the market, up
from zero.
• The client has the lowest quality, highest prices, and worst delivery record
• Most of the sales are made to OEMs under long-term (5 year) contracts, usually
for the life of the model. The OEM does not design the hoses, just gives
specifications. The client does not sell to the transplants.
• Financial Information:

Client A B
R&D 10 15 20
OH 10 10 10
COGS 60 55 50
Sales 20 20 20","Approach
• Exploring industry trends will reveal that the overall market has declined by 20%;
thus, reduced demand is one source of the client’s loss in profitability
• Next, identify the area(s) in which the client has been performing poorly (quality,
cost, delivery).
• Recommend that the client needs to improve in these areas, but think through
which area should be targeted first. Possible answers include:
Change the sales structure (have dedicated representatives for each firm,
change the sales representative’s incentive structure)
- Expand to the transplant market
- Increase R&D. The fact that the client’s R&D is low as compared to
competitors’ indicates that the client’s equipment is below.
- Try to expand the stamped products market"
"INSULATION MANUFACTURER
Background
Your client manufactures insulation. Profits have been declining over the past 3-5
years.
Question
What are the causes of the declining profitability, and what measures should be
taken to reverse the decline?
Additional Information
• Sales volumes are flat
• Profit Margin = 10%
- 10% SG&A
- 30% Conversion process (equipment and labor to make insulation)
- 50% Raw Materials
• Market Share:
55% Client
25% Company A
10% Company B
10% Small, regional players
• Insulation is essentially a commodity product, with little brand differentiation. The
market price is $15/lb. Most manufacturers are near capacity (say 90% of
capacity).
• The insulation is used mostly for residential houses. The market is closely tied to
housing starts (and therefore overall GDP, interest rates, etc.)
• Distribution:
- 55% to insulation subcontractors (hired by builders - hundreds of them, but a
lot of consolidation over the past few years)
- 25% to retail stores (Home Depot, etc – a segment formerly comprised of
many small retail stores, but which is being consolidated by Home Depot,
Lowes, etc.)
- 20% to building products stores
• Sales volume increases have been to subcontractors, at the expense of building
products stores
• Pricing Levels:
- Highest level to retail stores, but declining due to the consolidation of retail
stores which is giving the retail stores more buyer power
- Mid-range prices to building products stores
- Rebates to volume purchasers in subcontractor market. (This is the most
price sensitive segment, because insulation is 95% of their COGS).","Approach
• To determine the cause of the declining profitability, explore the client’s customer
base. This will reveal that the shift in sales towards subcontractors, who are
becoming consolidated and thus gaining more buyer power, is reducing the
average price and thus eroding the profit margin
• Recommend to raise prices to all customers. Since the client is the industry
leader, others will follow the price hike. Furthermore, if the competition undercuts
the price, they don’t have the capacity to steal away the client’s market share."
"DEPARTMENT STORE
Background
The client is the CFO of a major department store. One year ago, a major competitor
opened a store down the street from one of its suburban locations. Since then, the
client’s store has experienced a loss in profitability.
Question
Why has the store lost profitability, and what should it do to increase profitability?
Additional Information
• The competitor services the same clientele
• Although both competitors operate nationally, we are only concerned with the
local market.
• The client’s sales are down by 30%.
• The clientele is comprised of 50% yuppies and 50% retirees.
• The competitor has:
- Same size store, same product mix
- Same prices as the client
- Parity in all other areas
• The client’s product mix consists of :
- Clothing (no change in sales)
- Appliances (35% decline in sales)
- Furniture (35% decline in sales)
• The competitor bundles a service contract into their price","Approach
• The first step is to exploring the exact loss in profitability (decline in sales of
appliances and furniture).
• Next, determine why there is a loss in those areas. Investigate if the competitor
offers different brands or different services (services contract).
• Upon realizing that the competitor is beating out the client on service,
recommend that the client make changes to its operations. Possibilities include:
1. Motivate and/or rehire the sales staff (i.e., hire better skilled sales
representatives or improve the sales incentives for sales in the poorly
performing areas)
2. Change the displays and layout in the store.
3. Match the competitor’s service policy."
"TEXTILE PRODUCTS
Background
A diversified UK manufacturer has retained your firm because its Textile Products
Group is experiencing declining revenues.
Question
Please identify why you believe revenues are declining and what recommendations
you would make?
Additional Information
Industry
• Group produces finished textile products such as uniforms, jackets, rucksacks,
etc.
Customer Segments
• Products are sold to a variety of segments
• The true problem lies with the Government Sales Division and sales to the US
government specifically.
Competitive Environment
• Industry is relatively fragmented with tight price competition. Number of
competitors decreased in early 1990’s as US government purchased fewer
products and less efficient producers were driven out of business. Client
survived this consolidation with relatively small difficulties.
• Excess capacity exists within American manufacturers and worldwide.
• Lobbying by US manufacturers has led to increasing emphasis by US
government to buy goods made in America. The end result is slight preference
for US companies, but foreign manufacturers still allowed to compete.
Competitors
• Roughly 10 players at any given time with market share almost equally
fragmented. Largest competitor has roughly 25% of market, but most have less
than 10%
• Client formerly had 12% of market, but now has less than 5% and continues to
slide.
• Largest competitors are distinguished by having better manufacturing ability
(variety and delivery time) than other American competitors but roughly equal to
client.
• Competitors cannot match quality of client who is ISO 9000 certified for both
development and manufacturing. No US manufacturers are ISO 9000 certified.
Client’s Strategic Starting Point
• In past, client was able to succeed through being relatively strong in all areas:
price, time, variety, and especially quality. Regulations are tilting the field against
the client.
• Client has excess UK capacity; therefore has preferred manufacturing only in UK.
• Client has recently partnered with a Malaysian manufacturer in order to pursue
bidding opportunities in Far East, where low prices are paramount. Client offered
manufacturing and quality expertise in exchange for equal split of production and
profits.
Economics of Business Decision
• Labor is 70% of costs and is therefore low labor rates are critical to overall price.
• Client’s cost structure differs slightly from that of American competitors. UK has
lower labor rates than US, but transportation costs are obviously higher to ship
finished goods from overseas.
• Customer segments: US government segment is only problem – all other
segments are achieving forecasted positions.
• Achieving ISO 9000 certification is time-consuming and expensive process due
to high learning cost for management to develop proper procedures. Once
procedures are developed for a specific type of manufacturing process, they are
easily transferred to other facilities.","Approach
Bad answers
• Exit industry.
• Continue competing on same basis.
Good answers:
• Start up an American manufacturing division from scratch. Will allow client to
compete, but exacerbates problem of excess capacity in addition to entry costs
(which are relatively low).
• Buy a current American manufacturer to circumvent regulations, while not adding
to capacity. Client could obtain funds for purchase but is not thrilled with
prospect.
• Lobby US to change “Buy American” regulations or encourage UK to match US
regulations until policy is changed (time-consuming process).
Best answer:
• Copy client’s Malaysian strategy by having client partner with an American firm.
Offer to bring partner’s standards up to ISO 9000 level in return for share of
production and profits. Client’s profits from US market will decrease compared
to historical level, but this is a given due to the current market environment."
"CONSUMER GOODS MANUFACTURER
Background
A consumer goods manufacturer has retained your firm because its snack foods
division is not performing as well as the competition.
• Frito Lay is the dominant player with 42% of the market, revenues of $5 billion,
and operating profits of $1 billion or 20%.
• Client has 8% of the market, revenues of $850 million, and operating profits of -
$25 million or –3%.
Question
The data above shows a 23% difference in operating profit margins. What is the
cause of this 23% gap?

Additional Information
• Division produces snack foods – primarily chips (potato, tortilla, etc.) but also
items such as cookies and cakes.
• Price: Frito Lay and client charge roughly the same prices for 80% of the product
range. However, for tortilla chips, Frito Lay charges $2.99/bag, while the client
only charges $1.99. Tortilla chips account for 20% of client revenues.
• Client’s costs break down as follows: COGS 45%, Shipping 5%, Local Market
Distribution 31%, Promotion 7%, Overhead 12%
• Client’s local delivery trucks deliver $3500 worth of goods each week, while Frito
Lay’s deliver $6000.","Approach
• Price: Tortilla chips are 20% of client revenues = $170 million. Frito Lay is
receiving $1 more per bag of chips. $1 is 50% of client’s price. 50% of $170
million = $85 million. $85 million is 10% of $850 million. Price accounts for 10%
of the 23% gap.
• Cost: Candidate must recognize that Local Market Distribution accounting for
31% of costs sounds high. Frito Lay is receiving $2500 per week more than
client, which is 42% of the $6000 total. 42% multiplied by 31% = 13%. Local
Market Distribution costs accounts for the remaining 13% of the 23% gap."
"REGIONAL ASIAN BANK
Background:

The processing division of a large regional Asian bank wants to improve its cost-to-
revenue ratio (CRR). Present calculations reveal that the current CRR is 0.60. The

client wants to improve this to the industry standard of 0.40.
Question:
What strategies can the client pursue to lower its CRR to 0.40?
Case Information:
The client provides back-office services for the bank’s three other divisions: Retail
Banking, Corporate Banking, and Regional Banking. These services include: credit
processing, payment processing, customer service processing, call center services,
and credit card processing.
The client receives $100M in annual revenues. In the past, revenues have always
grown or diminished in accordance with industry trends; costs increase and decrease
in proportion to revenue. This trend is expected to continue in the future. An analysis
of the revenue/cost distribution will show that revenue and costs are distributed
evenly among the three customers. [The candidate can calculate that costs are
approximately $60M]
The client is organized into three highly independent groups, with each group
servicing one customer. Analyzing the individual groups will reveal that none of them
stand out as being particularly inefficient, and they all have CRR’s of about 0.60.
However, there are many similarities and overlaps in the processes they perform (all
processes are handled internally). [There is no need for the candidate to explore the
specific processes or overlaps.]
A cost analysis will reveal two types of costs: labor and systems. Labor costs stem
from the organization’s workforce of 1,000 employees, with an average annual salary
of $40,000 to $45,000; salaries are in accordance with industry standards. [Salary
cuts are not advisable.] Systems costs are primarily IT related and comprise the
remainder of costs.
A study of the client’s IT systems will reveal that they are below industry level in
sophistication.
A competitive analysis will reveal that the average industry cost distribution is 60%
labor, 40% systems. No other information is available about competition.
The client has no control over the volume of revenue it receives from its three
internal customers. Furthermore, the client believes that strategies to boost revenue
by fine-tuning the operations of its customers are beyond the scope of the
engagement.
The client’s pricing for its internal customers is consistent with the industry standard.
The client is aware that it can increase revenues by increasing internal pricing, but
would like to hear other recommendations.","Analysis of Case:

The case can be approached by looking at ways to reduce costs and increase
revenues in order to hit the target.
The client’s labor/systems cost mix is 70/30%, compared with an industry standard of
60/40%. Upgrading IT systems may allow it to decrease its workforce, and reduce
overall costs.
The client can integrate its three groups, and look for synergies. Possible synergies
include integrating common processes and transferring best practices. This can
result in reduced manpower requirements and further cost savings. (The candidate
should list possible synergies that can occur from integration.)

Reducing costs may not be enough to achieve the target CRR. There are no options
to increase revenues from the internal customers; however, the client can explore
insourcing, where they can offer processing services to external banks for services
for which they have high competencies. This can increase revenues substantially
while bringing economies of scale.
The client can combine the insourcing strategy with outsourcing the processes for
which it does not have competencies and which are not highly sensitive. The client
can determine its strategy to maintain, develop, insource, or outsource the different
processes as follows:
Competency
High Low

"FAMILY RUN PIPE COMPANY
Background
The client is a family-run steel mill that sells pipes. Recently, revenues have been
going up, but profits have been decreasing.
Question
How can the client increase profitability?
Additional Information
• The pipe market is highly fragmented
• The company has a single plant that runs 24/365 and sells everything it makes
• The company sells two grades of pipes – thick and thin
• Both grades are commodity products, but thin is a higher grade
• Labor costs, steel prices, and SG&A have all been constant; recently, more has
been spent on manufacturing
• Profitability breaks down as follows
Pipe type Price / foot Man. Cost / foot Profit / foot
Thick $2 $1 $
Thin $10 $8 $

• The company sells the same length of pipe regardless of grade in any given time
period
• Sales have recently been shifting toward thick pipes","Approach
• Should ask about product breakdown early on; this should lead to a discussion
about price and cost for each product.
• Once it is determined that the thin grade is more profitable than the thick grade,
realize that there might be a shift in sales across products.
• Issues to address in shifting sales back to thin pipes:
− Is there demand?
− Do customers prefer one-stop shopping (need to keep both lines)?
− Is there equal wear and tear on the plant?
Common Pitfall
Getting stuck on evaluating “pipes” together and not breaking out the two grades"
"CASINO PROFITABILITY
Background
The client owns 30 casinos across the US.
Question
How can the client increase profitability?
Additional Information
• The major US casino markets are currently saturated in terms of numbers of
casinos.
• Several competitors exist in each market.
• Profit margins break down as follows
Game Profit margin Profit/game (candidate should calculate)
25 cent slots 20% 5 cents
1 dollar slots 10% 10 cents
Blackjack 5%
Craps 2%","Approach
• Realize that the client needs to grow store for store. This implies increasing the
number of visitors or increasing the level of gambling/visitor.
• List possible ways to do each:
− Increase number of visitors:
1. Get frequent gamblers to visit more often / stay longer
2. Attract new gamblers
3. Extend geography
-- Increase level of gambling/visitor
1. Make it more fun
2. Push higher margin games
3. Stay longer on boat
4. Provide easier access to funds
5. No waiting lines
• Focus on “pushing higher margin games” – should ask for data on profit margins
(see above)
• Based on this information, slots are the big opportunity
• This should lead to a discussion of how to maximize usage of $1 slots. Use
quarter slots as a hook, switch quarter slot machines over to $1 slots during
periods where there may be a wait for $1 slot machines, etc."
"WIDGETS MANUFACTURER
Background
A machine tool manufacturer produces widgets. The Company’s profitability has
been stagnant over the last five years and as a result, your firm has been
approached to resolve this profitability issue.
Question
How would you go about improving the profitability of the widget?
Additional Information
• Widget has no substitutes and no other applications.
• Company feels it is impossible to increase market share.
• Company only produces this type of widget and it is not possible to produce other
widgets.
• Market for these widgets is stable and is not growing.
• There are 3 major players in the market with the following pricing and cost
structure:

Market Share Price Variable Cost Fixed Cost
Client 30% $10 $2.50 $0.50
Competitor A 60% $10.50 $2.50 $0.25
Competitor B 10% $9.75 $2.50 $0.75

• There is no room to lower marginal cost.
• Fixed costs cannot be lowered either.
• Customer feels it is essential that widget works because of safety reasons.
• Relationships with customers are based on trust and are long-term.
• Cost of widget is small compared to total cost of final product for client.","Approach
• Can either use Revenue/Cost approach or 3Cs
• Market has three main players that all utilize large markups
• Candidate should concur with Company view that stealing market share will be
difficult since this is a relationship business, and it could cause a price war which
would destroy the oligopoly profits currently being made in industry.
• Assume market is small, hard to break into, and other major players have no
interest in diversifying into this product.
• Because customer is very price inelastic, only way to increase revenues for client
is to raise price."
"OIL AND GAS COMPANY
Background
An oil and gas company has been experiencing a decline in profits.
Question
What is the root cause, and what would you recommend?
Additional Information
• The company is fully vertically integrated; its value chain includes exploration,
drilling, distribution, refining, and gas stations
• The industry as a whole has not experienced any significant changes in
profitability
• There have been no changes in profitability in the exploration, drilling,
distribution, or refining segments of the value chain (do not give up this
information too easily – let the candidate dissect the value chain)
• The company has recently opened up several new gas stations and located them
in wealthy suburbs; fixed costs have gone up
• The dembvand for gas is the same in wealthy suburbs as in other areas; the
company has not been losing money on gas
• The demand for fast, cheap, microwave, “gas station” food is much lower in
wealthy suburbs than in other areas; the company has been losing money on
food/drinks","Approach
• Begin with the 3C’s in order to determine what the company actually does; this
leads to a value chain discussion
• Dissect each segment of the value chain in terms of profitability
• Once it is realized that gas stations are the problem, inquire about the sources of
revenue from gas stations
• Realize that the root cause of the problem is that the company has been losing
money on food/drinks due to a mismatched product offering; recommend that the
company cater to its new customer base and adjust its product offering
accordingly"
"SOAP PRICING
Background
A company that makes one soap product has noticed that it is losing market share
and suspects that its pricing is to blame. The company currently charges $1.20/bar
as opposed to $1.00/bar charged by competitors.
Question
Should the company lower price?
Additional Information
Market
• Currently selling 15 million bars/year; were selling 20 million bars/year before
the firm started losing market share.
• The soap market is a mature industry (not growing rapidly).
• The company believes that lowering its price to $1.00/bar would boost volume
back to 20 million bars/year. (How would you test this? Consider a demand
analysis using demand instruments.)
Industry
• The company has a reputation of producing the highest-quality product on the
market.
• The industry is dominated by four main competitors. Currently the firm’s
market share is 12 percent. The competitors have market shares of 30, 20,
17 and 10 percent respectively.
• Currently, the client has the capacity to handle virtually any increase in
demand.
Cost Structure
The company cannot specify the overall cost of a unit (except that it is less than
$1.00 and greater than $0.80), but it does know the cost structure to be the following:
• 30 percent labor
• 20 percent inputs
• 20 percent general and administrative
• 20 percent overhead
• 10 percent other
The company is unsure if it has any cost advantage over other competitors, but it
clearly enjoys a reputation for the highest-quality products.","Approach
A profitability framework would probably work best here. Focus on incremental
revenue and cost numbers since total revenue and total cost numbers are not
available.
• Competitive Response: Reducing price would probably lead to a price war.
Since it is improbable that the company has a cost advantage, it would lose a
price war.
• Incremental Revenue: Using the assumption that demand would go from
15 million units to 20 million units with a $0.20 price decrease, the
incremental revenue would be 5 ( 1) = $5 million. But the firm would lose
$0.20 on the 15 million units for a $3 million decrease in revenue; so the
price decrease would lead to a net revenue increase of $2 million.
• Incremental Cost: Since the company has the additional capacity,
assume that labor and inputs rise linearly with volume and that everything
else is fixed (the candidate ought to suggest this assumption).
Sample Cost Numbers:
$1.00 leads to $0.50/unit, giving rise to $2.5 million.
$0.80 leads to 0.40/unit, giving rise to $2.0 million.
• Incremental Profit: The numbers above give an incremental profit ranging
from (0.5) to 0.

The incremental profit numbers, combined with the probability of a price war, make
reducing the price to $1.00 a bad idea. The company should focus instead on
quality, brand image, or segmenting the customer base."
"DIGITAL CAMERAS
Background
Client is a consumer good / consumer electronics company. One of its products,
Digital Cameras has never made a profit since its inception although the division has
enjoyed double digit growth the last 4 years. Investors are getting impatient with the
negative earnings.

Questions
1. What is a good target profit margin for the client (can be zero)?
2. Should the client exit the business?
3. What recommendation would you make to the CEO regarding the digital
camera division?

Additional Information
• Client sells digital camera through various retail channels: Wal-Mart, on-line,
photo shops, etc.
• Client does have different segments of camera, but for the purpose of this
case assume an average camera, priced at $200.00
• Quantity sold has been increasing, but client has been losing share across all
segments
• 4 major competitors:

Firm % Share Price
A 40% $220.00
B 15% $300.00
C 10% $260.00
D 10% $250.00

• 3 factors affect customer buying decision: brand image, good resolution and
good lenses
• Client has brand equity because of its presence in related markets
(camcorder, etc) and also use similar lenses to its competitors
• Client is not involved in any auxiliary product or services.
• Client’s cost per camera is the same as A - $205 per camera
• Cost structure

Cost Description A Client
Direct material 60% 40%
Direct labor 15% 40%
SG & A 10% 15%
R & D 10% 7%
Margin (to be calculated by candidate) 5% -2%
• Client’s assembly is done in the U.S, A’s assembly is done in a plant in
Beijing","Approaches
1. Use a REVENUE/COST or similar framework to structure your analysis
2. Do not try to probe the ‘average’ camera issue – this is a simplification, but
the other issues are more important in this case.
3. Conclude that client is losing share because of its poor resolution problem
and determine by comparing costs that this is most likely due to inferior
material
4. Use the numbers and table to quickly determine that the client is making a
loss due to the expensive labor – assembly in U.S. This is also why the client
is forced to buy inferior materials.
5. Determine that by outsourcing client can upgrade its direct material quality to
be competitive with A and make a 3% margin (R&D structure is fixed for
client)
Outstanding Answer
1. Note that closing plant will have union issues and outsourcing will have an
initial investment so a 3% margin may not be worth the effort
2. A low cost player (with inferior parts and outsourced assembly) may fetch
high margins but margins are not likely to last
3. Probe marketing synergies with other units – Does a presence in digital
camera help the camcorder division?
4. Do not be afraid to suggest exiting the business if your analysis does not find
any ‘nuggets’.
5. If you do recommend staying in the business make sure you outline why
staying in a commodity type business will help the client."
"INK-JET PRINTERS
Background
Our client is a world leader in printers – they manufacture different kind of printers
and have had a dominant market share in all categories of printers. However, the
CEO is worried that they might be losing share to competition.

Question
1. Is this true?
2. If so, how do we rectify the situation?

Background Information
• Five categories of printer: Category 1 being the slowest and Category 5 being
the fastest. Faster printers are used by commercial and slower by home
consumers.
• Competition and market share data as follows:
Printer – type Category 1 Category 2 Category 3 Category 4 Category 5
A (Sales) 4MM 1MM - - -
B (Sales) - - 2MM 5MM 20MM
Client 5MM 2MM 4MM 4MM 50MM

Printer – type Category 1 Category 2 Category 3 Category 4 Category 5
Industry ave
growth 20% 10% 5% 5% 4%
Client
growth -5% 10% 5% 5% 3%

• Category 1 customers are home consumers and care only about price
• Category 5 (candidate should deduce from above) is mature and does not
offer too much room for growth
• A’s printer is far inferior to client’s printer
• Price: client: $89.00, A: $49.00
• Client has 2% margin. Cost of printer to A is $69.00
• All manufacturers also supply cartridges – consumers buy $200.00 worth
of cartridges over the life of the printer.
• Consumers have to buy cartridges from the same manufacturer
• Firm A has a margin of $100.00 on the cartridges
• Client has a long-term, non-negotiable agreement with a Japanese
company for their category 1 printers. Margin is $20.00 on the cartridges
• Difference between category 1 & 2 is only in speed – (2 is faster)
manufacturing cost is the same. Agreement with Japanese player only for
category 1 printers","Approaches
To structure an analysis, first understand a bit about the company, the products (mix)
and see if there has been any price/quantity drops. Next, understand the customer
segment we serve, the benefits they seek and see if the competition is gaining share
because of a better product or better price. The 3-C framework works best for this
case, but one could also just look at it as a REVENUE/COST framework.
1. Client is growing at industry average in 3 of the 5 segments and slower than
industry average in 2, so conclude that the client must be losing share.
2. Category 1 clearly has higher potential because of high growth rates and the
fact that it also only has one competitor.
3. Firm A is pricing lower than the client does and customers are very price
sensitive – this is the cause of our poor performance.
4. Printer margins: Firm A = 49 – 69 = Loss of $20.00. Client, with a 2% margin,
makes ~$2.00 per printer.
5. However Firm A makes a profit of $80.00 on the printer + cartridges (100 –
20), while client makes only $22.00. In fact Firm A can give away the printer
for free and still make $11.00 in profits because of the cost advantage with
cartridges.
6. Do not be distracted by ‘loss-leader’ strategies or by harping on the quality
issue – these are possible answers but clearly it’s a price discrimination
(razor-blade) issue here.
Outstanding Answer
1. Client should start selling category 2 printers with a re-negotiated contract. If
our price is in the same range as Firm A, customers will prefer a better quality
/ faster printer and we can easily dominate the high-growth market."
"FREQUENT-EATER PROGRAM
Background
The CEO of a fast food chain wants to introduce a ‘frequent eater’ program.

Question
1. Is this a good idea?
2. What are the risks/issues that one must consider?

Additional Information
• For every $1.00 a customer spends, they get 1 point. The plan is to give
away a sandwich once a customer accumulates 20 points
• Candidate can start working assuming an average store and fine-tune later.
• An average store has around 8,000 ‘heavy’ eaters and 12,000 ‘light eaters’ –
segmentation beyond ‘heavy’ and ‘light’ not very relevant for this case
• Market survey indicates that heavy eaters will increase the frequency of visits
from 30 to 36 times a year; light users will increase frequency of visits from 9
to 12 times a year.
• Customers spend an average of $4.00 for every visit – this is the same for
heavy / light. (Heavy users just come more often, as explained in point 1).
• Around 20% of the heavy users are expected to participate in the program.
• Around 5% of the light users are expected to participate in the program.
• The “give-away” sandwiches cost $1.00 to make and there is a 50% gross
margin on the average items sold.
• Only 50% of the consumers who participate ever redeem / use the coupons.","Approaches
A revenue / cost approach works best for this case. The goal is to determine if this
program is profitable for the average store. Structure your analysis to determine the
revenue and cost drivers, thereby getting the information listed above. It is ok to
make some calculation errors, but it is important to identify all the revenue and cost
drivers and the participation %’s.
• Heavy user participants = 20% * 8000 = 1600
• Increase in revenue for heavy users = 1600 * (36 – 30) * $4.00 = $38,400.
Gross increase in earnings (50% margin) = $19,200.
• Light user participants = 5% * 12000 = 600
• Increase in revenue for light users = 600 * (12 – 9) * $4.00 = $7200. Gross
increase in earnings = $3600.
• Net increase in gross earnings = $22,800.
• Cost of providing free sandwich to heavy users = 1600 * (36 * 4 / 20) =
$11,520. At 50% redemption, the cost is $5,760.00

• Cost of providing free sandwich to light users = 600 * (12 * 4/20) = $1,440. At
50% redemption the cost is $720.
• Net value to average store is (phew) = $22,800 – $6,480 = $16,320.
• So conclude that program will be profitable to the average store.
Outstanding Answer
• Structure all your calculations so that they are easy to follow – this way, if you
make a mistake, the interviewer can correct your numbers. Also, it is OK to
approximate / ball-park, but you should state your approximations loudly.
• Once you prove the program is valuable for the average store, think about
problems associated with different kinds of stores: highway stores may not
benefit as much as stores in suburbia for example!
• What if competition comes up with a similar program? Will there be any
increase in visits?"
"CREDIT CARD – MILES & MORE PROGRAM
Background
The CEO of a major credit card company is interested in having an airline frequent
flyer program. The program would give the customer one frequent flyer mile for every
dollar charged. Customers can redeem the miles for one round-trip ticket (within US)
for every 5000 miles. The program is intended for a new card that the company is
planning.
Question
• Is this a good idea ?
This case does not have any specific information – the candidate must be tested for
structure, organization and creativity in his analysis. The candidate is also expected
to make estimates of market size.
Additional Information
• Company gets 1% for every transaction from merchants
• Average customer is expected to have balance of $2000 on the card and
have transactions worth $5000 a year. The interest rate is 20%
• Cost of the redeemed ticket - $200.00
• No new investment is required – existing systems/personnel can be used.","Analysis
The issues are best discussed in a REVENUE/COST framework as below:
Revenue:
• Program would be attractive to people who fly frequently. Do a back of the
envelope calculation to estimate the target segment. For example: 100 million
families in the US, 50% have credit cards – 50MM size of base segment.
25% travel more than once a year – so a potential 12.5MM cardholders will
consider the program favorably. Conclude that there is an attractive target
segment
• Next estimate the revenue per customer: 2000 * 0.2 + 5000 * 0.01 = 450.00
Cost:
• Cost of infrastructure/support for new program – negligible as we already
have an infrastructure in place.
• Cost of ticket $200.00
• Need to think about acquisition cost (promotion): ~$50.00
Strategic Issues:
• Sticky customers (good), blackout problems with tickets (bad)

• Will all credit cards"
"AUTO PART MANUFACTURER
Background
Your client is a manufacturer of an auto part. It is a relatively simple part to
manufacture, yet it is essential to operate a car.

Question
How can the company experience growth across its distribution channels?

Additional Information
• Part goes under the hood
• Market: slow growth (mirrors inflation rate)
• Competitors: 3 other main competitors
o Client has 30% share, Biggest competitor 30% share, others split the rest
• Repair: part can be replaced by customer (do-it-yourself) or by a mechanic

• Current Channels (after-market) – 1) Small mechanics (70%) 2) Large full-
service mechanics (10%) 3) Auto Parts Chain Stores (10%) 4) Mass

Merchandisers (10%)
• Market Mix – 1) Small mechanics (40%) 2) Large full-service mechanics (20%) 3)
Auto Parts Chain Stores (20%) 4) Mass Merchandisers (20%)
• Prices client charge – 1) Small mechanics ($85) 2) Large full-service mechanics
($70) 3) Auto Parts Chain Stores ($60) 4) Mass Merchandisers ($50)
• Client manufactures 30 Million units
• Market Demand: 100 Million units
• Client Costs: Mfg. Cost ($45/unit), Transportation ($10/unit to small mechanics,
$5/unit to others); all other costs are negligible","Approach
Determine the most profitable channels and the ones with the most potential. The
key is making sure you have asked for/received the relevant information and then
making the necessary calculations. The following tables give way to a potential
method for cracking the case:
Channels Client

Since the small mechanics channel has the most potential as well as the greatest
margin/unit, it is clear that a good strategy would be to devote additional resources to
growing this segment which already represents 70% of their business."
"WHITEWAY ELECTRONICS
Background
Our client is the second largest manufacturer of white electronics (micro-waves
ovens, dish-washers, refrigerators, washing machines, etc.) in the US. The client’s
profitability has declined over the last few years (no specific decline given).
Question
How would you approach / analyze the situation? Make a recommendation.

Additional Information
• There are 7 competitors in the US market. The leader and our client lose
money while the third largest competitor is profitable.
• The industry is growing at a very slow rate, primarily driven by demographics,
and margins are increasingly under pressure due to domestic and foreign
competitors. We assume, however, that manufacturing and R&D of all foreign
competitors is done in the US.","Approach
The usual approach revenues lest can be used.
• There is limited information available on the revenue side. Given the broad
range of products, there is no average price. All we know is that our client is
second in the industry in terms of revenues. We can also assume that
pricing strategies are comparable to our competitors with low- and high-end
products.
• In terms of cost, the following information is provided [in percent of revenues]:

 Labor 30%
 Material (including components) 60%
 Overhead 15%

HINT: The sum is >100%. The company’s financial loses equal to 5% of the
revenues.

• As mentioned before, player #3 is the only profitable competitor. Its costs [in
percent of revenues] are:

 Labor 30%
 Material (including components) 50%
 Overhead 15%

• Several possible ways can be explored to identify why our client has higher
material costs:
o Raw material: most of the raw material is steal and plastic =>
commodities. Our client has a large volume of sales => economies of
scale => purchase of raw material represents an advantage over its
competitors.
o Components: Our client has the same suppliers as its competitors.
There is, therefore, no difference in terms of quality and price per unit.
o Design. The R&D people claim that products are modified in order to
improve quality and functionality, and to meet any new market
demand. It appears, however, that a product with the exact same
functionality, price, and comparable quality has 30% more
components than competitor no. 3. This explains the difference in
material cost between our client and competitor no. 3.

Conclusion: Our client is an R&D driven company (the value added chain can
also be part of the analysis). The products were of good quality, yet more
expensive and more complicated to assemble than those of competitor no. 3.
How would you prove to your client that their products are more complex?
One possible answer is to take two products (from our client and competitor no.
3) and compare the number of components.
• Product mix is not an issue. It has remained the same for several years and
margins are about the same for all product-lines.
• Fixed and variable costs are not an issue and do not explain the difference in
profitability."
"VIDEO GAMES
Background
The CEO of a large, diversified entertainment corporation has asked a McKinsey
team to examine the operations of a subsidiary of his corporation that manufactures
video games. Specifically, he needs to know if he should approve a $200 million
capital request for tripling the division's capacity.
Question
You are a member of the McKinsey team assigned to this project. Assume you and I
are at the first team meeting. What are the critical issues we should plan to examine
to determine if the industry remains an attractive one in which the CEO can profitably
continue to invest and why?
Additional Information
The following information may be given if requested by the candidates, though
you should focus on having the candidate identify issues, not obtain more
information.
Market Share
• Division is third-largest manufacturer of hardware in the industry with 10
percent market share.
• Top two producers have 40 and 35 percent market shares. Remainder is
divided among small producers.
• Division sells to broad range of consumers.
Sales
• Division sales have increased rapidly over last year from a relatively small
base. Current estimate is annual sales of 500,000 units.
• Current estimate of industry hardware sales is 5,000,000 units annually.
Industry growth has been strong overall, though sales growth has slowed
over last few months.
• Division's current sales price for the basic unit is $45.
• Division accounts for less than 20 percent of parent company sales.
• Top two competitors also develop, manufacture, and sell software/games,
although division sells only licensed software.
• Growth of software continues within the industry.
Costs
• Division estimates current cost per unit is $30 fully loaded. Requested
expansion should reduce the cost by 5 to 7 percent and triple production of
the hardware units.
• Top two competitors are currently estimated to have a 10 to 15 percent cost
advantage.
• Main costs are for assembly components and labor.
Customers
• Division estimates much of initial target market (young families) has now
purchased the video game hardware.
• No large new user segments have been identified.
Distribution
Primary outlets of distribution are toy and electronics stores.
Profitability
Division currently exceeds corporate return requirements; however, margins have
recently been falling.
Product
• The industry leaders have established hardware standards.
• Product features are constantly being developed (e.g., new type of remote joy
stick) to appeal to different segments.","Approaches
The primary issue in the case is to determine if the industry remains attractive and,
especially, if our client's position within that industry is sustainable. The candidate
should identify issues that are necessary for assessing both the industry and the
client's position, but should not be expected to solve the problem.
If the candidate begins to discuss a specific issue too deeply, before having covered
the key issues overall, bring him/her back to discuss the industry more broadly by
asking, ""What other issues must be examined?""
If the candidate is discussing issues that seem irrelevant to the attractiveness of the
industry, ask, ""How will that analysis help to assess the attractiveness of the industry
or the client's position?"" Then, ask the candidate to identify other issues that must
be examined.
Minimum Requirements
The following issues would need to be covered for the candidate to have done an
acceptable job:
1. What is the future market potential? Candidate needs to question the
continuation of overall industry growth. S/he might ask about the saturation of
markets, competitive products (home computers), and declining ""per capita""
usage.
2. What is the competitive outlook? Candidate must at least recognize the need to
examine competitive dynamics. Issue areas might include: concentration of
market shares; control of retail channels; and R&D capabilities (rate of new
product introductions, etc.).
3. What will be the price/volume relationships in the future? Issues of price setting
need to be considered.
Better/Outstanding Answers
No bounds on creativity, but better answers would address:
Market Potential
• Recognize that there is a relationship between market penetration and growth
in new users which, when combined, yield an industry volume estimate.
• Address the shifting mix of product purchases, in this case from hardware
(player unit) to software (video cassettes).
• Seek to look at buyer behavior in key segments; i.e., determine ""fad"" potential
of product.
Software
• Recognize that the industry leaders set technology standards. In this
situation, the division, as a secondary player, will have to follow these
standards.
• Recognize that different distribution needs may exist for different products (in
this case software versus hardware).
Price/Volume Relationships
• Discuss the effect capacity additions can have on overall industry
price/volume relationships and on industry price levels.
Competitive Ability of Firm
• Ask what the capacity expansion is designed to do.
• Explore the cost position of the client division relative to that of other
competitors.
• Seek to understand reasons for the poor profit performance of the division."
"ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT
Background
An electrical equipment manufacturer has been losing market share.
Question
What should the company do?
Additional Information
Product
The company only has one product line, industrial circuit breakers. The circuit
breakers currently on the market are undifferentiated from a quality standpoint, and
are also completely interchangeable.
Competition
There are two competitors.

Competitor A Competitor B Client
Market share two years ago 25 35 40
Market share today 38 35 27
Price/breaker $9.00 $8.10 $9.50
There have been no price changes over the past two years. Market share was fairly
constant prior to that period. The market is mature. Competitor A has stolen market
share from the client.
(Do not give this point away too easily): About two years ago, Competitor A began
delivering circuit breakers via overnight air freight instead of regular U.S. mail.
Competitor B has always used second-day air. The client relies on regular U.S. mail
shipments.
Customers
The circuit breakers are generally purchased in large quantities by large
manufacturing plants. Since the circuit breakers are used on large, very expensive
machines, the price per unit is much less important than reliability. There is a large
downside risk if a circuit breaker proves faulty, and substantial financial implications
if a customer runs out of circuit breakers (machines cannot be operated).
The customer base is very fragmented, representing most manufacturing companies.","Approach
The key point in this case is to uncover the fact that Competitor A has stolen some of
the client’s market share by increasing the level of service. The criticality of the
product to a customer’s business makes price a secondary purchase criterion.
Competitor A has been targeting the client’s customers and convincing them to
switch to superior service. To remedy this problem the client should consider adding
overnight delivery service. However, this maybe insufficient since the client asks a
higher price and the enhanced service will only match that of Competitor A
(customers will still have little incentive to switch)."
"GUMMY SUBSTANCE PATENT
Background
The client makes a gummy substance used in foods and oil wells. The firm holds a
patent on the substance but suspects that a substitute will be invented in
approximately one year.
Question
Is this new substitute a threat?
Additional Information
Product
The substance is used in foods like gelatin, gummy bears, etc. In oil wells it is used
to keep the head on. All of the inputs to the product are commodities.
Market
The food market uses 200,000 lbs/yr and the oil market uses 50,000 lbs/yr. The
industry is mature with relatively little growth. The client has many customers,
especially in the food segment.
In the oil well segment, the product represents a very small percentage of the total
cost of production, but the product’s failure has large downside risk implications. If
the gummy substance fails, causing the head to pop off, it can create large losses for
the oil company. Hence, the oil company purchasing decision is primarily based on
quality and reliability.
In the food segment, the gummy substance represents about 50 percent of the total
costs.
Company
Due to the monopoly the client enjoys, margins are very high. The firm currently
charges the same price in both segments. The client has a strong reputation for both
quality and reliability.","Approach
The candidate should discuss the following:
• Segmenting the market is critical. If there is a way to avoid arbitrage the
client firm may want to consider price-discriminating in some way between
the two segments.
• In the oil segment the company enjoys a much more stable position. The
focus on quality and reliability combined with already insignificant cost will
make it difficult for any competitor to gain market share.
• In the food segment the client is more threatened by the substitute.
• In both segments the firm should try to build a brand image, after the pattern
of “nutrasweet”, for example.
• In both segments, the client might pursue long-term contracts with some
customers to preclude entry by a manufacturer of the substitute, but this
strategy might prove difficult, give the number of buyers."
"THEME PARK MARKET SHARE
Background
ThemeCo is an operator of a theme park in Florida. Recently, although revenues
have increased, market share has been dropping.
Question
What is causing this disturbing trend and what can be done to reverse it?
Additional Information
• ThemeCo is one of several theme park operators in southern Florida.
• Most of the theme parks are within a 11⁄2 hour drive of each other.
• About one-half of total revenues for each park come from admission fees.","Approach
A profit tree could be used both to isolate the problem and to consider possible
solutions:
• Increase the number of people coming to Florida.
• Increase the number of visitors.
• Increase the % of people coming to your theme park that are already in
Florida.
• Increase the number of days people visit ThemeCo.
• Increase the frequency of use.
• Increase the ""length"" of the ThemeCo day (to increase revenue from food,
etc.).
ThemeCo’s underlying problem stems from the fact that DisneyWorld has increased
the ""length"" of an average visit from 1⁄2 day to 3⁄4 day, thereby reducing the time
visitors spend at other attractions in Florida. Although Disney’s new attractions have
increased the size of the total market, they have also increased Disney’s share of
that market."
"SUPERMARKET COMPETITOR ANALYSIS
Background
ShopCo, a large supermarket chain in the southeast has have never used strategy
consultants before, but is concerned about the changing competitive dynamics in its
market and has approached your firm for assistance.
Question
Should ShopCo feel threatened by entry of Wal-Mart Supercenters into its market?
Additional Information
• ShopCo is the largest seller of groceries in the market with a 25 percent
share.
• There are two other large chains with shares of 20 percent and 15 percent,
respectively. The rest of the market is highly fragmented.
• Wal-Mart Supercenters are basically regular Wal-Marts with large grocery
shops attached that operate on a 24-hour schedule.","Approach
Use 3C/4P analyses.
• Wal-Mart can exploit economies of scale in many areas (labor, distribution,
etc.) to reduce costs and possibly achieve greater margins than
supermarkets. This is important because the supermarket business is
traditionally thin-margin.
• The cost economies for Wal-Mart are on a logarithmic experience curve, so,
with greater traffic through their stores, their margins on both food AND their
traditional product lines will actually grow.
• The supermarket should be really worried. Wal-Mart can LOSE money on its
supermarket items and still earn a lot from increased margins on its traditional
Wal-Mart goods."
"FOOD DISTRIBUTOR
Background
Your client is a large food distributor. The CEO is thinking of exiting the business.
He is basing his decision on his profitability - he has a 2.5% margin, while a
competitor has a 4% margin.
Question
Is the CEO in a 2.5% business or a 4% business?
Additional Information
• There are 4 major players in the industry, our client is #2. The players are:
• #1 $6B in revenue, 4% margin
• #2 (Client) $6B in revenue, 2.5% margin
• #3 $5B in revenue, 2.4% margin
• #4 $5B in revenue, 2.2% margin
• The client has a reputation for good operations: Its fleet is well maintained, it has
excellent routing, and almost always ships full trucks.
• The #1 firm has a similar mix of customers, also ships full trucks, and has fewer
trucks than the client.
• Our warehouse is located across the street from #1’s warehouse.
• Drivers for all firms are union employees.
• Food makes up 70% of costs, while distribution makes up 25% of costs.
• Customers vary from white tablecloth restaurants to low end diners, and the mix
is the same across all four firms.
• #1’s customers are physically closer together.","Approach
• The candidate should deduce that the food distribution is a near perfectly
competitive industry, where prices are set by the market and margins are low.
Therefore if revenue is the same for #1 and #2, then price and quantity are the
same for both firms.
• The candidate should recognize that food purchased by the distributors is a
commodity, and that food costs for all competitors are the same. They should
focus on the distribution costs, and not the food costs.
• The candidate should ultimately conclude that if sales are the same for both
firms, operations are similar, number of customers are the same, and the #1 firm
has fewer trucks, then the delivery time must be shorter for #1 and the physical
distance between customers is shorter. Thus, the #2 player is in a 2.5%
business, unless they can steal customers from #1, which is unlikely in an
industry of this nature."
"US/CANADIAN DRUG SALES
An international pharmaceutical firm sells an ethical (prescription) drug for nasal
infections. Per Capita sales in the US are much higher than sales in Canada.
Question
Why are per capita sales different between the two countries?
Addital Information
• A nasal infection is an ailment with symptoms much like a cold. People
cannot self diagnose a nasal infection.
• The competitors are the same in the US as they are in Canada.
• This is a prescription drug - it is not sold over the counter. Given a
prescription, patients in both countries will have it filled. Insurance will pay for
it.
• Americans are no more or less likely to contract a nasal infection, or show
symptoms than Canadians.
• Canadians with nasal infection symptoms are will visit the doctor 60% of the
time, while Americans will visit the doctor 30% of the time
• Canadian doctors are twice as likely to misdiagnose a nasal infection. In
other words, Canadian doctors diagnose a cold or flu, when the patent indeed
has a nasal infection (the candidate should ask for the magnitude of
misdiagnosis - 10% in the US and 20% in Canada).
• For a diagnosis of nasal infection, American doctors prescribe the client’s
drug 70% of the time versus 33% of the time in Canada
• The price of the drug in the US is 25% higher than the price in Canada.
• Canadian patients receive no refills for their prescription on average, while
Americans receive 1 refill on their prescription","Approach
The key to this case is to identify the process by which a person receives the drug.
Since all comparisons are made in per capita terms, the candidate should not focus
on market or population size differences between the two countries.
There are several steps in the process. The approach should identify the relevant
steps in the process, in order, and compare US and Canadian revenues at each
step. A good answer will identify four of the five steps in the process, a very good
answer will identify all 5 steps, and an excellent answer will identify all five steps and
be able to calculate the relative difference in sales between the two markets.
A good way to approach this case is to start with 100 patients, compare revenues
through each step in the process. The five steps in the process are:
• Of 100 people with undiagnosed nasal infections 60 Canadians will go to the
doctor versus 30 Americans
• Of the 60 (Can.)/ 30 (US) people that visit the doctor 80% (Can.)/90 %(US) will
be correctly diagnosed 48 (Can.)/27(U.S.).
• Of the 48 (Can) / 27 (US) people that are diagnosed, 33% (Can.)/70%(US)
receive a prescription for our drug: 16 (Can)/19(US).
• Of the 16 (Can)/19(US) people that are prescribed the drug, the US revenues are
25% higher than the Canadian revenues. This is equivalent to having 25% more
people receive the drug. The 19 US people are 24 revenue equivalent Canadian
patients.
• Of the 16 (Can)/27.5 (US) equivalent patients, Canadians, on average, receive
no refill, while Americans, on average, receive 1 refill. Again, each US patient is 2
revenue equivalent Canadian patients. The 24 American patients are 48 revenue
equivalent Canadians.
• Overall, US revenues are three times higher than Canadian revenues - 48
revenue equivalent US patients versus 16 revenue equivalent Canadian patients."
"CONTROL SYSTEMS
Background
A large firm has a division which makes control systems. The client, the control
division makes timers, both electrical and mechanical. The timers are used to turn
circuits on and off (lights, photosensors, temperature gauges, etc). The division’s
growth is flat, but profitable.
Question
What should they do in order to double growth in five years?
Additional Information
• There are 3000 domestic distributors for the control systems
• The distributors cover all geographic regions in the U.S.
• The case is limited to the U.S. domestic market
• Market and Competitors
- The client has 25-30%
- Company A has 30%
- Company B has 35%
- Others have 10%
• The control systems are pretty much commodities, although there are minor
differences in look, price, and features
• The substitutes are basically any type of manual switch. For example, the lights
in a parking lot could either be mechanical, or turned on and off according to a
pre-set pattern.","Approach
• One key idea is understand who the customer really is. Who makes the
purchasing decisions?
- 30% Electrical subcontractors: not price sensitive (Why?)
- 30% Architects and design engineers: not too price sensitive (Why?)
- 40% Building managers (of existing buildings) More price sensitive (Why?)
• Growth Options:
- Expand geographically (not the answer - client is already national)
- Expand the current market – see below
- Explore new applications (segments) for the product
- Develop new products using the client’s expertise at control systems
• Expanding the Current Market: Target owners of multiple buildings, i.e. hotels,
restaurants, Federal Government, states and municipalities, schools
• How do you reach them?
- Advertise in trade publications
- Use sales representatives to call on hotel operators"
"UTILITY DEREGULATION
Background
Bain was hired by a large utility whose market is being deregulated. Although the
utility produces both gas and electricity, we will only concentrate on electricity.
Regulations are changing so that customers can purchase electricity from any
producer. The regulations also dictate that the transmission and generation sides of
the utility will be run separately. That means that the client must provide equal
access to all generators of electricity who wish to transmit their electricity in the local
market.
Question
What does the utility have to do to prepare for a competitive environment?
Additional Information
• There are 2 million customers:
- 300 large firms (30% revenues)
- 170,000 small firms (30% revenues)
- Remainder are residential","Approach
• The key idea here is business transformation. To transition from being a publicly
regulated utility to a profit-oriented competitor will require organizational changes,
job/skill changes, new procedures, and a new mindset. Some possible ideas are
below.
• Move to Activity Based Costing (ABC), which helps a large bureaucracy organize
into profit and loss centers; helps identify where costs are going
• Create metrics for sales, customer service, and installation. The new
organization will need to develop a customer service orientation. In order to do
this well, the utility must set up ways of measuring customer service. One good
way would be to associate a specific profit (price revenue) with each customer,
thereby segmenting the customers.
• Marketing and Sales:
- Have dedicated sales representatives for large customers
- Use separate marketing campaigns
- Focus on quality for large firms, lumpy orders
- For regular customers, use team bonuses for meeting customer sales metrics
- Retrain staff, hire new staff with customer service skills
• Try to expand geographically (since the client is an equal or lower cost producer."
"COMPUTER MANUFACTURER
Background
Our client is the industry leader among computer manufacturers, but is losing market
share dramatically.

Question
We have been brought in to figure out why and how to resolve the issue?
Additional Information
• Client manufacturers desktops, laptops and servers.
• Client manufactures both high-end and lower priced computers and is
technologically very competent.
• Client is only losing market share in laptops and desktops.
• Client has an extensive distribution system through retailers like Best Buy, Circuit
City etc.
• Client offers good servicing arrangements through the retailers’ service
personnel, however they do not have in-depth knowledge of the client’s products
since they service other competitors’ products too.
• Evolving industry with numerous players
• One new player has been stealing market share and is growing rapidly.
• The new player sells directly to customers through its own salespeople and does
not have a distribution network
• The new player offers service through its own sales-force, which is very
knowledgeable. It also has a help line for computer problems which need
immediate servicing.
• Consumers want customized equipment.
• They are leaning towards more repair services, free installation etc.","Approach
• This is essentially the Compaq-Dell scenario. The case looks to judge how well
the interviewee buckets the problem into various segments before he/she looks
for clues. Structure is very important here and the interviewer must decide how to
reveal information. Reducing the problem into the following buckets and then
drilling down could be one option.
• Company/Products
• Distribution
• Competition
• Technology
• Customers
• Essentially, the case involves identifying the advent of a new player with a direct
distribution system. In addition, the interviewee should identify the change in
consumer preferences. Finally, the interviewer can lead the discussion towards a
recommendation i.e., the pros and cons of the client changing to a direct
distribution and how it would impact current relationships/sales."
"AUTO DASHBOARDS
Background
The client is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of auto-dashboards to auto
manufacturers in the U.S and Europe. “Auto-dashboard” refers to the display panel,
and all the gadgets within, that is directly behind the steering wheel, and is a modular
product. One of the client’s leading competitors in Europe has approached the client
with a possible contract / agreement to jointly supply dashboards in Europe

Questions
1. Analyze the pros and cons of a partnership with the competitor
2. What’s the motive behind the competitor’s request?
3. Should we partner?

Additional Information
• Client designs and manufactures instrument (dashboard) clusters
• Client presence in North America, Europe and Asia. Competitor is present
only in Europe and any partnership would be restricted to European region
only
• Customers are primarily auto manufacturers – Contracts are long-term in
nature. For example BMW typically would work with the supplier for cars to
be rolled out 3 years in the future
• Product mix: 3 types of dashboards – high end, middle and low end
dashboards. Maps to high-end, middle and low end autos – but car
manufacturers may offer upgraded instrument panel on any car
• The customer base in Europe can be categorized as 20% low end, 50%
middle and 30% high end. Margins across these segments are low: ~0%,
middle: 1-2% and high: 12-15%
• The high end segment has the fastest growth
• Competitor has 50% of the high end market and no presence in low and
middle end market. Client is primarily a player in the low end and middle
market segments with 5% presence in the high end market
• No big difference in quality, features and functionality between competitor
and client
• Industry trend to have same modular dashboard across different segments to
have economies of scale. Low end BMW and High end BMW will have the
same basic box, with the only difference being in some bells and whistles.","Approaches

1. Structure the analysis using a 3-C or similar framework to
methodically get all the required information
2. Understand that low end is a commodity and client really is not
making too much profits right now, while the competitor is –
hypothesize that there must be a strong motive behind the sudden
urge to ‘share’ profits!
3. Analyze the given facts and figure out that auto manufacturers
have substantial bargaining power – and may be looking for same
supplier for all 3 of their segments
4. Competitor makes a pre-emptive move to partner with client to
avoid auto manufacturers switching their high-end dashboard
supplier to someone who can supply dashboards for all 3
segments, like our client.

Better Answers
Additional questions and observations should include a clear discussion of the pros
and cons of the partnership beyond the motive:
1. Pros: Economies of scale for client, but since this is an “arms-length” contract
both parties may not merge operations.
2. Pros: End customer relationship may be better streamlined – one team per
auto manufacturer instead of one team per segment
3. Pros: Research & Design costs can be shared.
4. Cons: Lose opportunity to be a big player in the profitable high-end market
5. Cons: Agency costs – competitor may not share its high end segment with us
in a fair manner
Outstanding Answers
1. Candidate should recognize that a lot of operational synergies are not
possible in an “arms-length” contract such as this one. So pros should be
based on practical synergies in a partnership situation
2. Recommendation can be either to partner or not, but should be based on
candidate’s estimate of the advantages versus the disadvantages
3. A nice way to understand the issue is to go through the value chain from
design to manufacture to assembly to customer relationship and articulate
what a contract will mean in each of these stages
4. It is very important to understand the macro issue – auto manufacturers are
moving to integration of the segments – before getting into the details of the
case."
"FREE OIL
Background
You are the CEO of American Airlines. You have just learned that tomorrow the price
of oil will drop to zero. Obviously, this has significant ramifications for your business.

Question
What three people would you want to talk to regarding this development and why?

Additional Information
• Price of oil, including transportation and refining costs, is zero
• Cost of jet fuel is zero
• Assume that oil companies make oil at zero profits
• Ignore geo-political issues
• No other specific information – Candidate must decide on the critical issues","Approaches
The interviewer should seek to conduct a conversation, where the interviewee
creates a structure and works through questions such as the following:
• How does this change impact the business – revenue drivers?
• What is the cost structure of the airline?
Fuels costs are a significant portion of the operating costs of an airplane.
Thus, it is likely that prices could be reduced. This will result in an increase of
primary demand. People who might have taken the bus, train, or car might
now be willing to fly at the lower cost.
• What effects will increased demand have on utilization rates?
• Do you need more planes? Is there going to be a first mover advantage?
• Are Boeing and Airbus going to be able to make enough planes to meet the
new demand? Will the prices of planes go up? Can airports handle more
planes?
• Will planes travel farther now since they have no fuel costs?
• How will competitors react to this news?
So, who might you talk to (not an exhaustive list by any means; there are many,
many others):
• CFO or Accounting Officer who knows about the internal cost structure will be
able to tell you what new items will be driving cost and constraining operations.
• Market Researcher – how does one sell the new airline to the public?
• Labor Unions – labor will be a bigger factor in the cost structure
• Airbus/Boeing - can you get more planes if demand increases? Can you get
planes that fly longer (more fuel capacity)
• Airport Authority – can you reserve more landing slots before others?
• Competitors – without discussing prices and avoiding collusion, are there
other things you can learn from your competitors?
• Once again, there are no right answers here – the question is did you discuss
the strange issue intelligently? Did you pick three reasonable people and does
your logic support the three you picked?"
"FROM BEER TO WINE
Background
A relatively small time beer company is looking for opportunities to generate more
revenue. It is facing a very competitive market in the beer industry and wants some
diversification in its product portfolio. They do not have too much cash at hand and
are open to the idea of financing projects through debt. After a vacation in California
one of the VPs of the company suggests that they should consider venturing into the
wine business. According to him, its still in the alcoholic beverage industry, there
seems to be evidence that wine drinkers is a growing demographic and they thus
might be able to make some money through that business.

Question
• Is this a good idea ?
This case does not have any specific information – the candidate must be tested for
structure, organization and creativity in his/her analysis.","Analysis
The candidate should perform an industry analysis to determine what to do.
One of the suggested approaches is to:
• Determine the current landscape - How is wine made, what does one need?
VineyardsÆGrapesÆprocessingÆbottlingÆagingÆdistribution
• How much expertise is involved? Are there any similarities between beer
brewing and wine making?
A lot of expertise is involved since there are no similarities between beer
brewing and wine making i.e. negligible techniques from the beer industry
can be utilized.
The candidate at this point should realize that wine making is a very different beast,
and in addition the aging process implies storage costs and capital investment
lockup. These two points should be considered the main barriers to entry
• How many winemakers are currently in the market place
• What is the capacity utilization of the current wine makers
• What is the current profit margin in the business
• Perform a market analysis/assessment - is the wine market really growing?
• How loyal are the customers, are they price sensitive, brand sensitive?
• Are there economies of scale involved
• Advertisement costs, distribution channels, preexisting alliances.
• Are there economies of scope possible (Most probably not, but can be
broached if a interesting option is thought of)
• Touch on financial requirements
Based on the above answers the candidate should suggest that this will not be a
viable option due to: Lack of expertise required to make wine, excessive cash
required due to storage costs. No significant economies of scale except maybe
distribution channels, but don’t have to enter the wine business for that."
"DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY
Background
An English company has hired you to evaluate its recent diversification into a new
market. This firm has manufactured car batteries domestically for over thirty years
and is the quality leader in the U.K. market. Two years ago, the product line was
expanded to provide batteries for forklift trucks. Soon after a successful introduction,
however, sales in this segment began dropping steadily.
Question
What recommendations would you have for this company? Also, briefly describe
how each recommendation should be presented to the owner.
Additional Information
• The forklift business was added to utilize idle capacity during periods of
inactivity.
• This is a mature industry (1% annual growth in the last two years).
• There are:
♦ 4 domestic producers (declining market share)
♦ 1 German producer (stagnant market share)
♦ 1 Spanish producer (increasing market share).
• The Spanish firm offers low-priced batteries of inferior quality.
• Captive salespeople sell the firm’s forklift batteries to industrial dealers.
• Free maintenance service is included with every sale.
• Consumer battery purchases in the automobile market are highly
seasonal.
• Large customers are sophisticated and buy on the basis of price and
quality. Smaller customers are less sophisticated and buy solely on price.
• An ""old school"" manager/owner has been in charge since the firm was
founded.","Approaches
Establish an Off-Brand
1. Protect firm's quality image in the automobile industry.
2. Attempt to achieve potential cost savings:
• Sell factory-direct to dealers (i.e., no sales force)
• Redesign product (cheaper chemicals, less reliable housing and
contacts, fewer manufacturing processes, etc.)
• Eliminate free maintenance service; instead, provide brochures
illustrating how to top-off fluid levels, clean electrical contacts, etc.

3. Adjust prices to compete with Spanish producer.
Educate the Consumer Market
1. Develop product positioning. Some examples may include reliability testing,
relative cost savings, lifetime warranties, etc.
2. Leverage quality leadership position in the car market.
3. Set higher prices than other competitors to extract surplus from these
advantages.
Exit the Forklift Battery Business
1. Producing for this segment does not fit with the company's quality image.
2. Other opportunities may offer superior profit potential:
• Exclusive contracts with other market segments or OEMs (Original
Equipment Manufacturers).
• Forward integration into golf carts, industrial equipment, etc.
• Backward integration into specialty chemicals, plastic injection molding,
etc.
Do Nothing
1. Wait to see how the market reacts to your product in the long run.
2. Boost owner's ego by supporting his earlier decisions.
This approach may be a hard sell given the owner's investment in consulting."
"OFFICE SUPPLY DISTRIBUTOR
Background
The client is the largest office supply distributor in the United States and sells directly
to large corporations. Revenue and profit were going up linearly but then turned
around. Market share was increasing but is now flat. The client is willing to spend
lots of money but demands high growth.
Question
What should the firm do?
Additional Information
• The client currently serves 90 percent of large corporations (i.e., no potential
for high growth in this segment alone)
• Currently the client is the only national distributor. In the 1980’s there were
thousands of mom and pop distributors, but they are mostly gone now,
replaced with regional retailers.
• The client has the best contracts with suppliers due to large volume.
• The client also has the best quality of service. The service provided is
unmatched in the industry.
• The company has been losing customers to competitors. In fact, it invested a
lot of money and implemented a large new purchasing system that keeps
detailed purchasing information. Customer feedback indicates that all
customers are ecstatic with the firm’s service, but find that it is often more
expensive than its competitors.","Approach
There are several keys to this case that the candidate should reveal.
• To experience high growth, the company cannot remain only in the large
corporate segment. It must instead focus on two strategies: 1) protect its
dominance in large accounts and 2) attach new segments.
• There are two meaningful ways to segment the market: size and willingness
to pay for service. In fact, willingness to pay for service turns out to be the
more important.
• One important recommendation would be to offer differing levels of service.
The client currently has a lot of information concerning which customers are
willing to pay for which levels of service. The firm should use this information
and offer different prices for different levels of service. The segment offers
the greatest opportunity for growth is the segment not willing to pay for extra
services.
• Should the client consider buying regional retailers? Not really; where are the
synergies? Since the client already generally obtains the best discounts
possible, there would be few synergies in purchasing regional retailers.
• Providing the salesforce with incentives is also an issue. Currently the
salesforce has a number of incentives to pursue large corporate accounts.
How could that be changed to create the proper incentives?"
"CONSUMER PRODUCT INNOVATION
Background
A consumer products company with stagnant market share is quickly losing its
innovative reputation as it is more frequently merely adding line extensions rather
than new products. This loss of innovation is well documented.
Question
What are the drivers of this trend? What would you do to fix it?
Additional Information
Customers
Market research has shown that customers do value innovation.
Competitors
Other companies are still being innovative. In fact some of the innovations of other
companies are similar to new products which the client worked on, but discontinued.
Company
• The company has over 10,000 products, about 50 percent of which have an
unchanging market share. Forty percent have declining market share (largely
due to offbrands) and 10% have increasing market share. Some of the
products, but not all, are in mature product lines. It has been well
documented that mature product lines seldom result in innovations.
• The company has the reputation for producing the highest-quality products.
• The firm spends a great deal on R&D. There has been no decrease in the
percentage of sales spent on R&D, but is now much more fragmented. R&D
used to all be co-located, and a study showed that scientists spent 30 percent
of their time on research. The directors desire to be in the middle of
everything has resulted in scientists spending a lot of their time preparing
reports about what they are doing.
• The company has become much more risk-averse over the past few
decades. Failures are penalized much more heavily than they used to be.
Great disincentives exist to share information.
• The firm has no formal process in place for developing new product, and is
largely driven by the gut instincts of directors of the division. There is no
focus on product potential or the development paths to pursue for promising
candidates.","Approach
The candidate should discuss the following areas:
• Address the need for new product development. Create processes for
assessing which products to pursue and which not to not pursue. These
processes may include analysis of cost structure, market dynamics, revenue
stream, cannibalism, etc. Also ensure that any new processes are monitored
to maintain accuracy.
• Create a more innovative and friendly environment. The culture has created
disincentives to be innovative and take risks, a trend that needs to be
reversed. Investigate ways to create incentives to share information and take
educated risks.
• Investigate ways to get more bang for the research buck. One possibility is
finding ways to focus more scientist time on conducting research instead of
writing reports.
• Focus product development efforts on non-mature product lines. Suggest
doing more investigation on which product lines have the highest probability
for successful innovation."
"NEW CHEMICAL MARKET PENETRATION
Background
A new chemical, a substitute for sulfites, has been discovered and patented. Sulfites
are used to preserve packaged foods such as fruits and vegetables. They can
increase the shelf-life by 10-14 days. Two percent of the population is allergic to
sulfites, some to the point where they could die from consuming them. The FDA has
been leaning towards eliminating sulfites, and they have in fact been banned in some
countries. The new substance has been tested only on fruits and vegetables, and
there are no side effects.
Question
How can this new substance be commercialized?
Additional Information
Customers
The primary buyers of sulfites are produce companies, who in turn sell their products
to grocery stores and restaurants. Grocery stores sell sulfite products such as
bagged vegetables, such as carrots, and/or prepackaged salads. Restaurants use
sulfite products to help preserve vegetables which they purchase prepackaged.
Product
• Sulfites are basically used for keeping fruits or vegetables like lettuce fresh
when they are packaged.
• Sulfites extend the shelf-life of some foods by 10-14 days is priced at $1.50/
pound.
• Substitutes extend shelf-life by 3-5 days and are priced at $1.50/pound.
• Without using sulfites or other substitutes the shelf-life is less than 24 hours.
• The new substance extends shelf-life by 10-14 days and costs $6.00/pound
($5.00 raw materials only).
• Reliable research indicates that the patent is not imitatable.
• One pound of sulfites is required to treat 20,000 pounds of vegetables or
fruits. Takes 1 pound to do 20,000 pounds of vegetable or fruits. One pound
of fruits or vegetables costs approximately $1.00.
Distribution
• Grocery stores have a turn rate of 200 to 300 (per year). This means that
they hold fruit or vegetables for about 2 days before they are purchased by
customers.
• Restaurants have a turn rate of 100 (per year). This indicates that they hold
the fruits or vegetables for about 3.5 days.
• Produce companies take one day to get from the produce company to the
restaurant/grocer.","Approach
Computations show that it costs less than one cent per bag of product to use the
new substance. The bottom line, the cost to the produce company, is insignificant
compared to the cost of the fruits or vegetables.
• Grocery stores do not receive the produce until it is already 3 days old, which
means that the substitutes for sulfites give the produce a shelf-life at the
grocery store of 0-2 days. This does not give ample time for consumers to
store and use the product after purchase. The substitutes for sulfites are not
a viable option.
• Restaurants do not receive the produce until its already about 4.5 days old
which means that the substitutes for sulfites are not a viable option
Thus, the sulfite substitutes are not a good option for the new drug or sulfites. The
new drugs primary competition will be sulfites. A three-pronged approach may work
best:
• Enter markets where sulfites are already banned. Can charge very high
prices there due to the lack of alternatives and small amount of sulfites
needed for large amount of product.
• In other markets, highlight the lack of side-effects to win over market share
from sulfites.
• Explore the ethical and logistical issues of getting sulfites banned in other
markets. This might be accomplished through petitions and/or getting new
regulations imposed. If sulfites are banned, the new chemical would enjoy a
very lucrative monopoly.
Other issues the candidate might want to consider are manufacturing and
distribution."
"HIGH-TECH MARKET POSITION

What should the firm do to continue to grow its market position?
Additional Information
Product
The company offers two primary products. The first is a new disk drive with
capacities of 7,000% of existing floppy disks. The other is an even larger drive with
disk capacities of 70,000% of existing floppy disks. The company owns patent on
both the disk drive and the disks.
Customers
• Household use: There are three primary uses for the product in homes: 1)
data backup, 2) augmenting an existing hard drive, and 3) enabling
manipulation of large files (replacing floppy disks).
• Industrial and specialty use: Can be used by large offices and companies for
storing images and backing up large systems .
• OEM suppliers: Computer manufacturers purchase the drive to include as
built-in options in their products.
The market is estimated to total one billion dollars with a current penetration of 5
percent.

Suppliers
The firm single-sources almost all of its components.
Complements
Computers and software are both considered complementary products.
Distribution
The company has effective distribution channels in the United States but lacks
similar networks abroad.
Promotion
The company currently spends slightly more than the average on advertising and
promoting the products.","Approach
The candidate should touch upon a few different topics. How easily copiable are the
drive and disks (the company has a patent, but how easy is it to sidestep)? He/she
should also conclude that this is a razor/razorblade situation; the company should
focus on ways to increase market penetration. Once a market leader is established,
the high switching costs and network externalities will make this leader harder to
overcome. The hardware and software distribution channels will not support two
standards. This will be a winner take all market eventually. The company could try
to increase market penetration and share by:
• Going after software distributors
• Going after hardware distributors
• Marketing aggressively to increase market share
• Pricing drives at or perhaps even below costs"
"HEALTHCARE NEW PRODUCT
Background
HealthCo, an integrated healthcare solution provider, is thinking about introducing a
new product for its medical supplies division. The product is a pre-packaged,
custom-made sterile procedure kit.
Question
Determine whether HealthCo should launch this product or not.
Additional Information
• The procedure kit would contain sterilized apparatus used in operating rooms
(e.g., gloves, sutures, swabs, etc.).
• The kit would be sold for approximately 10 percent more than if the items
were purchased individually.
• The kit contains all the equipment needed for particular kinds of basic
medical and/or surgical procedures (i.e., removal of an appendix).","Approach
The interviewee should determine three things: (1) market size, (2) the economics of
the business, (3) value proposition.
• The maximum market size can be determined by the sum of the market sizes
of all the individual components (~300MM/yr). Realizable sales are
dependent on the individual market segments and their economics in
adopting pre-packaged kits.
• Hospitals could save on labor costs (nurses currently have to prepare the
sterilized components in the operating room), ordering costs (each

component is ordered and tracked separately), and administrative costs (pre-
packaged kits allow for consolidation of suppliers). Pre-packaged kits should

also be easier to monitor and manage, thereby reducing stockouts. Since
each kit would set up for a certain type of operation, the economics of
purchasing each kit would vary by the complexity of the operation.
• The kits would most likely be sold to institutions that perform certain medical
procedures on a regular basis. Seventy percent of individual component
sales are made to large hospitals, with the balance going to smaller
institutions. The large hospitals will realize potentially larger savings than
smaller institutions, since they tend to perform the same procedures often.
Thus, kit sales are likely to represent some percentage of sales of individual
components to large hospitals.
• Consider cost to provide kits: Inventory, Marketing, Distribution, etc.
• Consider cost savings to hospitals: reduced administration & increased
productivity"
"PHARMACEUTICAL SALES FORCE
Background
PharmCo, a UK-based pharmaceutical company, has an existing sales force and a
well respected product line. However, new products in the pipeline have failed at the
Research and Development (R&D) stage. Hence, PharmCo’s sales force is currently
underutilized.
Question One
PharmCo has advertised in trade journals, offering to sell other companies’ products.
The response has been excellent and PharmCo wishes to narrow down fifteen
possible new products to the two most viable candidates. How can it do this?
Additional Information
• PharmCo’s traveling sales force visits customers (doctors and pharmacists)
at their place of business.
• PharmCo is known for its high-quality, moderately priced line of
pharmaceuticals.
• PharmCo may have other competing products in development or may be
moving away from some market segments.
Question Two
The product development process consists of three phases.
Phase Cost per Product Success Rate
R&D $2 million 10%
Testing $10 million 20%
Product Rollout $50 million 80%
How many products do we need to undertake in order to generate two successful
ones?
What is the total cost associated with developing two successful products?

The basic approach is to determine which products are the best fit with the existing
distribution channel and PharmCo’s strategy.
• A 2x2 matrix analyzing what PharmCo currently desires to sell and what it
wishes to sell in the future would provide one solution to this case. The
matrix should have a high / low value proposition.
• The fifteen potential products must be analyzed for their match potential with
PharmCo’s current and future pharmaceutical product lines.
• The recommendation must also consider whether PharmCo will have
sufficient sales force capacity when its new drugs are launched.
• Different price points: Premium, Moderate, Discount or Branded verse
Generic

Approach
Thus, 150 products require development in order to generate two successful ones.
The total cost associated with developing two successful products is $600 million."
"NEW DRUG
Background
A start-up drug manufacturer has invented a preventative medicine for heart attacks
that took two years to develop and that will be ready to market in six months. The
drug is a tablet with no side effects and it significantly reduces the chances of a heart
attack.
Question
The drug manufacturer has decided to price the new entrant at $300 per year. What
is likely to happen at this price?
Additional Information
Product
• Must be taken every day.
• FDA-approved.
• Unlimited manufacturing capacity.
• Prescribed through cardiologists.
Customers
• Potential customers are Americans aged 50+ that are high risk for heart
attacks.
• Of Americans aged 50+, 40 percent are considered high-risk.
• Of high-risk Americans, 25 percent will have a heart attack by age 70.
• 40 million Americans are over 50. (Ask candidate to estimate this figure)
• It costs an insurance company $50,000 to cover every heart attack.
• There are no viable substitutes for this product.
","Approach
Calculate potential market:
• 16 million are at high risk for heart attack.
• 4 million will have a heart attack by age 70.
If interviewee does not calculate the market size, interviewer should ask how
insurance companies will decide whether or not they will cover this product.
The candidate may attempt to determine if it is cheaper to cover the product or let
people have heart attacks:
As we assume above, there are 16 million Americans age 50 or older who are
considered high-risk for heart attacks. One quarter of these (4 million) of them will
have a heart attack by age 70.
If an insurance company were to cover their prescriptions for this medication for 20
years:
16 million * $300/yr * 20 years = $96 billion. Assuming a 10% discount rate, the
present value of this amount is about $40 billion.
If the insurance company were to let people have heart attacks and then treat them
afterwards:
4 million * 50,000 = 200 billion. The present value of this amount is about $30 billion.
Given this price, the insurance company might not be willing to provide coverage for
this medication."
"BLOOD FILTRATION SYSTEM
Background
The client is a medical start-up company. It was founded by an engineer, who
developed a device that filters blood.
Question
The client wants to know the market potential and optimal price for this device.
Additional Information
• The only substitute for this device is bagged blood
• Approximately 30 million pints of bagged blood in the U.S. was used last year
• The filtration system is superior to bagged blood, for the increased assurance
that the blood has been appropriately filtered
• The price of using bagged blood in an operation is $2 per pint (equivalent to 1
bag), plus the cost for the attendant - $10
• The cost of the filtration system is the fixed cost for the machine, the cost for
each filter (one used per operation), and $10 for an attendant
• Operations can be segmented into 3 categories: Type 1 using 1-2 bags per
operation (50%), Type 2 using 3-5 bags per operation (25%), and Type 3 using
more than 5 bags per operation (25%). Type 2 and 3 operations use 90% of total
bagged blood used","Approach
• To identify the market potential, the candidate should inquire what substitute
products are on the market (only bagged blood), and what the sales of that
substitute product are each year (30 million pints)
• To determine what should be the price charged for the device, the candidate
should inquire about the price for bagged blood:
- For Type 1 operations, the average cost is $13 (1.5 bags of blood at $2 per
bag plus $10 for the attendant),
- For Type 2 operations, the average cost is $18 (4 bags of blood at $2 per bag
plus $10 for the attendant)
- For Type 3 operations, the average cost is $20 (5 bags of blood at $2 per bag
plus $10 for the attendant)
• The candidate should explore what the costs of the filtration system are:
- The cost of the machine
- The cost for filters (1 used per operation)
- The cost for the attendant (same as for bagged blood - $10)
• The conclusion should be that the client should charge a minimal price for the
cost of the machine so that hospitals will be willing to switch, and then charge a
price for filters that is comparable to the cost of bagged blood. Since 90% of the
blood is used in operations of 3 bags or more, which would cost a minimum of $6
for bagged blood, the client could charge $7 or more for each filter
• The use of a chart or table, summarizing the above information would make for
an excellent answer."
"ANIMAL PHARMACEUTICALS
Background
A client of McKinsey makes pharmaceuticals for animals (vaccines, antibiotics, etc.)
The products are used on cattle, chicken, horses, and pigs. Over the past few
years, the firm has spent $20 million per year on developing a new biotech product
for pigs. If the investment continues, it will be ready to market in three years.
Question
Should the client continue with this development?
Additional Information
• The client is the largest firm in the industry, with sales of $1 billion. There are
several other competitors, the next largest has sales of $700 million
• The biotech product is a swine growth hormone. It produces faster growth, and
reduced fat in the meat. The product has to be injected daily for the 100 days
prior to sale
• Savings to farmers if the growth hormone is as follows:
- 20% less fat ($10/head)
- 20% less time to adulthood ($20/head)
• The competitors have their own research programs underway. In three years, it
is expected that one competitor will have a similar product which only has to be
injected every four days, and the second competitor will have a product which
only has to be injected once every two weeks
• 100 million pigs are raised each year","Approach
• Determine customer interest? (Perform a telephone survey on current clients)
- 20% of the clients like it (small farms)
- 60% are neutral (medium farms)
- 20% hate it (big farms)
• Conclusion is that sales will be low, and will be surpassed by the competitors in a
couple of years who have a superior product"
"FARM EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER
Background
A farm equipment manufacturing company operates a diesel engine manufacturing
line, which currently has excess capacity. The client is considering manufacturing
truck engines but does not want to make additional capital investments.
Question
Should the client pursue this idea? (please see chart on next page)
Additional Information
• The company manufactures three diesel lines: 4L, 8L, and 12L
• The diesel engine market breaks down as follows:
Producer Current production Capacity
Large player (non-farm-equipment) 80 000 110 000
Other players (non-farm-equipment) 10 000 25 000
Client 5 000 20 000
Other farm equipment manufacturers 30 000 40 000
• Current variable cost profile (indexed to client’s total variable costs):
Variable cost Client Main competitor
Labor 20 20
Parts 60 54
Other variable costs 20 12
Total variable costs 100 86
• Variable cost profile at a volume of 20,000 engines
Variable cost Client
Labor 20
Parts 57
Other variable costs 16
Total variable costs 93
• The demand profile for the last couple of years is depicted in the graph below,
with demand expected to increase to 160,000 engines

SHOW TO INTERVIEWEE IF QUESTION IS ASKED Annual quantity
160,000 (projected)

125,000 (current)

Year","Approach
• The case should be approached through a combination of the 3Cs and
profitability
• The demand graph shows the characteristics of an economic cycle; the high
point is likely temporary
• Realize that the client can only compete if the marginal cost of production is
equal or lower than that of its competitor
• Based on the information provided, the total cost will still be above the marginal
cost of the main competitor; therefore, the client cannot compete in this market"
"PRINTING INK COMPANY
Background
A German maker of printing inks currently sells only in the European market (2/3 of
sales are in Germany). The company is a small, niche, family-owned firm known for
high quality and good technical support. The company has noticed that prices are
higher in North America and is considering expanding into this market?
Questions
Why are prices so high in N.A.? Will this trend continue so that the company can
earn a profitable margin in the new market? If the company decides to enter the
N.A. market, how should it go about doing so?
Additional Information
Customers
The company currently sells to 10,000+ printing shops; larger shops are more
demanding in terms of technical service, etc.
Competitors (North America)
Two national competitors provide more limited service; many regional competitors
provide better service; all are U.S. based
The use of a 2x2 matrix with Customers and Competitors is effective here.
Costs
Labor: 10% (higher in U.S.) Transportation: 5% (10% if shipping to N.A.) Raw
materials (mostly commodities): 45% (higher in U.S. due to exchange rates, but all
companies in N.A. get their materials from the U.S.)
Product
There are several quality levels of printing ink. The client sells high quality ink in four
base colors that are used by magazines, etc. There is no difference in product
quality requirements between Europe and N.A. The client provides technical support
for 1-2 days to new users of its products and ongoing support for specific needs.
Promotion
Direct sales and relationships are key, the candidate may suggest potential
partnerships or target add-on acquisitions.
Placement
Distribution is done through a logistics company in Europe","Approach
• The answer to the first question is that the higher costs (especially the raw
material costs due to exchange rates) are driving the higher prices in the N.A.
market. Most likely, the N.A. companies are not enjoying higher profit margins
but are just passing along the higher costs.
• Given the company’s strengths in quality and service, it still may want to enter
this large market. The problem is that direct sales and relationships are key to
selling this product, and the company would probably find it difficult to develop
these contacts as a new player in the N.A. market. The company should
probably consider partnering with a supplier of a complimentary product (i.e.
adhesives, varnishes) who could provide the company with a direct sales force
and help it develop its brand in the N.A. market."
"ENCYCLOPEDIA COMPANY
Background
An enigmatic Swiss trader has just bought an old and respected encyclopedia
company. He now wants to enter the Internet field. You have been hired as a
consultant to help him put a plan together.

Question
How would you advise him?

Additional Information
♦ No prior expertise in web-related services.
♦ Best brand name in the world for encyclopedia.
♦ Current product line – Print edition of encyclopedia, CD ROM version
♦ Capital is not a constraint.
In this case, the Swiss trader has no idea what the final “web” product looks like.
The candidate should first narrow down the possibilities, for example:
3⁄4 Search engine – (free/pay for use)
3⁄4 Web-site that peddles information (free/pay for use).
The trader wants a new search engine/site.","Approach
1. First determine the purpose of entering web-services – to design a product that is
much better than existing products, and to capitalize on the brand name at the
same time.
2. What is the value proposition? - To provide a search engine that provides
accurate information without hassles, quickly and efficiently.
3. Areas for discussion:
a. Competition
- There are two dimensions to choose from:
- Compete on quality
→ Google! main competitor
→ Requirements: human input to rate quality of content on websites
- Compete on powerful search engines, with no human intervention
→ Alta Vista, Excite, HotBot main competitors
→ Technology is the key competence.
- Choose the metric to measure performance against competition, and to
measure progress.
- Number of hits
- Ratings by internet magazines, and other raters on the Web
- Number of web-sites accessed or “listed”

b. Revenue sources
- Possible alternatives:
- Advertisers:
→ Advantage: Revenue stream more certain, need a smaller number
of payers to support operations
→ Disadvantage: Hassle of loading pages with ads to users
- Customers: ( Pay per use / periodic subscription)
→ Advantages: Users can be assured of ad-free operation, greater
credibility.
→ Disadvantage: Need a much higher customer base quickly to
support operations. Also future revenue stream is uncertain as it
depends on future usage.

c. Customers
- Who are your customers?
- Advertisers
- Visitors to web-site
→ Current audience– based on current usage data and current
profiles, e.g., age, income groups, types of sites visited, and main
purpose of using the Internet.
→ Future audience – will depend on trends in the industry, and
emerging major uses of the Internet.
(Note: The resolution of this issue needs to be done simultaneously
with the issue of revenue sources in (b) above. Since client is still
only exploring options, lay down the issues anyway)
- What does your target market want?
- Client doesn’t have any data. Need to find out. Methods: Online
surveys, etc. Be prepared to discuss what exact questions you will
put on this survey, what information you are trying to elicit, and how
you will use that information.
- How best to give customers what they want?
- This will revolve around web design, and selection of most appropriate
technologies to implement the site.
d. Core Competencies:
1. What core competencies are required?
- Depends on whether client wants to compete on “quality” or “quantity”
- Competing on quality makes more sense given their known expertise
in information, and their respected brand name.
- If competing on quality, key competencies required are:
- Access to current, accurate information.
- Brand name.
- Ability to constantly update information and new websites. This is
especially important if customers are paying for service.

2. What core competencies does the client possess?
- Brand name
- Expertise in the information business.
- Key take away from this analysis is that client lacks the technological
capability to maintain current information at the speed required in an
Internet-based business.
3. How is the gap between the two going to be bridged?
- Acquire the technology.
- Acquire skilled programmers.
- Issues to consider here are the cost of such acquisition versus the
benefit, and the time it will take to execute.

FINAL NOTE: THIS CASE HAS NO REAL “SOLUTION” AS IT IS
OPEN ENDED. THE CLIENT IS JUST LOOKING TO YOU TO
LAY DOWN THE ISSUES IN ENTERING A NEW BUSINESS.
AN EXCEPTIONAL ANSWER WILL SUMMARIZE THE KEY
POINTS IN A VISUAL MANNER VIA A CHART OR TABLE."
"DESKTOP APPLICATION SOFTWARE
Background
The client makes a software product that manages desktop applications across
different machines. There are 2 broad categories – large organization (with 1000 +
computers) and small organizations (100 – 1000 computers) that use the software.
Client has a strong presence in the small segment but has not been able to
penetrate the large segment.

Question
1. Why is the client not able to have a footprint in the large segment?
2. What recommendations would you have – stay / exit the large segment?
What tactics would you use if you decide to stay?
Additional Information
(Note to case giver: This is a numbers case – so guide the candidate appropriately)
• Desktop application software reduces crashes and calls to systems
administrator. It is a background application so the end-user does not even
know that it exists on his / her computer
• The client sells the software through computer retail stores that sell software
products. There are over 2,000 such retail stores across the country
• Large segments are more profitable than small segments, and currently the
small segment market is almost saturated. So from the client’s perspective,
they clearly need to sell more to large segment.
• Question is: How do we sell more?
• No other player operates in this niche – however an open source application
manager is in the cards
• Client software is extremely stable and has clear benefits because of reduced
system outage. These benefits are more for large companies than for small
companies
• Client sells the software, retail stores sell support services at time of sale.
• Retail stores sell using a direct sales force that visits the large / small
companies.
• The average license price for small firm is $2,000. Stores sell 100 licenses a
year and get a 10% margin. In addition retail stores sell support services
100% of the time for each license, each of which produces another $2,000 in
revenue with a total margin of 10%.
• The average license price for large firm is $20,000. Stores sell 12 licenses to
get a 25% margin. In addition retail stores sell support services 20% of the
time for each license, each of which produces another $20,000 in revenue
with a total margin of 25%.
• The actual sale is made by sales reps who get 1% of every $1 in revenue
they bring in to the store
• A sales rep can either make 8 small company sales or 2 large company sales
in a given month.","Approaches
While a 3-C approach works, a faster approach is to contrast the large versus small
company and look at the client’s product, competition and features in these 2
segments. You should quickly determine that the problem is in the channel, the open
source application is a distraction. Candidate should realize large companies will not
go in for open source until the product matures.
• Small company:

o Revenue = 2000 * 100 = 200,000
o Profit to store = 200,000 * 0.1 = 20,000
o Profit from support services = 200,000 * 0.1 * 100% = 20,000
o Net profit to store / store = 40,000

• Large company:

o Revenue = 20000 * 12 = 240,000
o Profit to store = 240,000 * 0.25 = 60,000
o Profit from support services = 240,000 * 0.25 * 20% = 12,000
o Net profit to store / company = 72,000

• Retail stores also get more profits if they sell to large companies.
• Sales rep incentive:

o Small firm = 8 * 40,000 * 0.01 = 3,200
o Large firm = 2 * 72,000 * 0.01 = 1,440

• Sales reps therefore tend to favor searching for small firms – which is okay if they
can make 8 sales a month, but this market is maturing so they are potentially
going on fruitless searches.
• The sales rep incentives should reflect the margin per sale and not just the net
margin.
Outstanding Answer
After you get the numbers an outstanding answer will just have to be creative:
• Merits / demerits of moving away from channel partner towards having a
dedicated direct sales force.
• Piggyback on another software vendor’s direct sales force.
• Partner with computer vendors (Dell, etc) to have software installed in OEM
fashion, etc."
"RESIDENTIAL CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONS
Background
Our client is a Residential Central Air Conditioning Systems manufacturer. A Market
leader in the US with 40% market share. The company is profitable with 10% EBIT.
Question
This company has a large R&D department that has just designed a new technology
that is much more energy efficient. It cuts electricity requirements (and hence costs)
by 50% to produce the same cooling effect.
Should you introduce the technology now? If so, how would you introduce the new
product?

Additional Information
1. Company is the market leader in new technology inventions
2. The durability of this technology is 3 years (i.e. the closest competitor will
take 3 years to copy the unit)
3. Revenue/Cost of old unit
• Revenue $2000
• Parts and Labor $1000
• R&D, Sales etc $400
• Fee to external distributor $400
• Profit $200
4. Revenue/Cost of new unit
• Revenue $???
• Parts and Labor $3000
• R&D, Sales etc $400
• Fee to external distributor $400
• Profit $???
5. There are certain economies of scale expected as manufacturing produces
more of the new units, as the volume increases to over 100,000 units, costs
will decrease by 20%.
6. Case recipient should notice that some costs are fixed and some are
variable. Also that the external distributor is currently receiving $400 or 20%
of the unit cost, will the company be able to keep the distributor at a fixed fee
of $400 or will they argue for an increase to 20% of resale value?
7. The lifespan of the unit is 10 years.
8. The US is split into 4 regions for air conditioning usage. NE, NW, SE, SW.
Average expenditure for electricity running air conditioning per year
• NE - $700 per year
• NW - $300
• SE - $1500
• SW $ 1200
9. How do people choose air conditioning units?
• 80% of sales are made on ‘price’ of the unit
• 20% of sales are made on the ‘lifetime value’ of the unit.
10. Company sales are 40% of total market, 30% to the price segment and 10%
to the lifetime value segment. (Notice our old product appeals more to the
lifetime value segment...the client has 50% of the lifetime value market)
11. There is only 1 other large player with a 40% market share and 6 regional
players share the remaining 20% of the market.","Approach
To answer the question whether to introduce or not, answer the question ‘Is the new
product going to be profitable? Will it make the overall business more profitable?’
Look at Revenue/Cost plus building or stealing more market share.
Get the cost information for the old and new product, try to decide if it will be possible
to gain a 10% EBIT on the new product, What price do you think you can sell the
new product for?
To decide this look at the lifetime savings customers get from using the new product,
the SE region customers will save $7500 over 10 years. If this is worth say $5000
today, could argue how many people are willing to invest today for savings over the
next 10 years and knock this down lower. Even if this is only worth $3000 to them we
could sell the unit for $5000. This creates an EBIT of $1200 or 23%. This would lead
you to believe that yes you should introduce the new product.
Now consider how to launch the new product. Target ‘Heavy’ user areas? Think
about how and why people buy air conditioning; get information as to product/unit
choice. Now see that company needs to target consumers who buy according to
‘lifetime value’. A good answer would consider other issues such as marketing
strategy, market to people with environment concerns as well as costs?
A very good answer would finally consider cannibalization of the company’s old
product. Will the company continue to sell only its old product in the more cost
conscious regions of the NE and NW. How much of our market for the new product
will be lost sales of our old product? How much can we expect to steal from

Background
The Singapore government is rewarding an additional wireless license via a bid
process. Vodafone, your client is considering whether it should attend the bidding for
this license.
First Question
Vodafone would like for to analyze the market opportunity and provide a
recommendation.
Additional Information
Market Size: Mobile use in Singapore is expected to increase 20% in 2004, 30% in
2005, 40% in 2006 and 30% in 2007. There are now 2.4 million mobile users in
Singapore. The average mobile user spends $60 a month for a mobile phone.
Customer Acquisition: To enter the market the company projects that it will have to
invest an incremental $100 million to acquire the first 200 thousand customers,
known as the minimum threshold to enter a new market. Each additional 10
thousand customers will require $1 million in advertising.

Competition: There are three players in the Singapore wireless telecom market who
have 60%, 30% and 10% of market share respectively.
Industry Economics: Industry EBITDA is 60%. The new is expected to cost $100
million.

Second Question: Based on your NPV analysis what assumptions are at risk and
why?
1) 200 thousand customers – competitors will probably respond. However, as
the current mobile-user market is growing at 40% and the current market has
2.4M customers. If our client focuses on new customers, which is 2.4M*40%
= 960 thousand it should be able to get 200 thousand customers.
2) 60% EBITDA won’t change. This is not necessarily true either as with new
entrants into the market, the current players might cut price to maintain their
market share. This could drive down EBITDA.
3) We assumed that the project would go on forever – there might be country
risk – e,g, Singapore government decided to nationalize the mobile telecom
market – though this risk is small, but we should also consider
4) We used the industry discount rate – which does not necessarily represents
the risk of the project.
Third Question: If the current market share were not 60%, 30% and 10%, but
40%, 40% and 20%, which market is better for a new entrant? There is not an
absolute answer to this, rather the candidate should pick a market and defend his /
her position.","Approach
The candidate should do following:
• Market Analysis – the size and growth of the market, profitability of the industry,
etc.
• Consumers analysis – Discuss what consumers value (i.e. features) and the
types of services they use. (there is no hard data on this point, rather the
candidate should speak about consumers)
• Competitor analysis – The candidate should recognize that the existing
competition will react to Vodafone’s market entry by offering more services,
better features, better coverage, lowering prices, etc. In addition, the candidate
should mention the importance of fully understanding the realm of possible
strategies that will circumvent competitor reactions. This does not need to be
specific, but this is analysis that will require further work.
• Client analysis – The candidate should mention that cost structure, core
competencies, and competitive advantages should be completely analyzed.
• Economics of the bid – cost benefit analysis to see whether the client should
attend the bid.
First consider the threshold investment. If the bid is profitable at threshold, then
assume that it is also profitable at added-in investment stage. If it is not profitable at
threshold stage, then consider added-in investment stage to see whether it would be
profitable (it is good to start with threshold investment only because you do not need
to consider the growth rate of the business for your NPV calculation – especially if
you have not learned corporate finance yet at this stage, this will save you a lot of
trouble).
Up-front investment: total $200 million (license $100 million + threshold investment
$100 million). Cash inflow = $60.00 * 200,000 * 60% * 12 = $86.4 million (every
mobile user spends $ 60*12 each year for mobile bills. Assume that you client is able
to get 200 thousand customers. EBITDA is 60%). Assume that the project could go
on for ever, and that the competitors’ discount rate is 20%. NPV = $86.4M / 20% -
$200M = $232M, which is positive, based on this; we should look deeper into this
project.
Below is a possible answer:
The 40-40-20 market is better for entrant as it is a more even market. In the 60-30-10 market,
there is an obvious industry leader and a small player (10%). The industry leader would want
to maintain its leadership position, while the small player does not want to be squeezed out of
the market. Thus the competition in this market would be stronger than the 40-40-20 market.
Since the mobile telecom market is a high fixed investment market, the small player in the
market would most likely cut prices to gain market share or keep new entrants out. So, in a
60-30-10 market, the competitors should be expected to respond stronger."
"CHEMICAL INDUSTRY MERGER CANDIDATE
Background
One major chemical producer has retained McKinsey to evaluate another major
participant in the industry. Both companies are bulk commodity chemical producers.
We have been asked to begin our work by analyzing the future prospects of the
target company's main product line, a bulk chemical used in the production of
plastics.
Question
How would you structure an analysis of the target company's future prospects in this
product line?
Additional Information
• Production of this chemical has slowly declined over the last five years.
• Prices have declined rapidly.
• There are 7 to 8 major producers; the largest producer has a 30 percent
share; number two has 20 percent; our target company has 15 percent; the
rest is divided among other competitors.
• The two largest competitors earn a small return; Target Company is probably
at break-even; the rest are operating at break-even or a loss.
• The largest competitor has just announced construction plans for a major
new plant.","Approaches
Minimum Requirements
The candidate should, at a minimum, address the following issues:
1. What markets use this chemical, and what has been the nature of growth in
these markets? (End-use markets are largely automotive-related.)
2. How much overall capacity exists now? (Far too much.)
3. What has been the relative capacity utilization of competitors in the industry?
(60 to 70 percent during the last 3 years.)
4. What are the relative cost positions of competitors? (Related to
size/efficiency/age of plant; target company has reasonably ""good"" position.)
Better Answers
Better answers will move beyond the previous answers to consider:
1. How rational is pricing? (Pricing is prone to self-destructive cuts to gain
temporary share points.)
2. Are there niche or value-added uses for the chemical? (Not really.)
3. Does the chemical have a major by-product or is it a by-product? (Not
significant.)
4. How often have company’s entered/exited, and how expensive is entry/exit?
(Entry is expensive; exit is cheap for most because older plants are fully
depreciated.)
5. How important is this product line to each of the competitors? (Most
producers are diversified.)
Outstanding Answers
The best answers could address:
1. Reasons for announced capacity expansion. (It is a bluff to get smaller
competitors to shut down.)
2. Is regulation important? (Yes: all competitors have installed pollution control
equipment.)
3. What operational improvements could the target company make? (Lots.)
4. How is the product sold and distributed? (Economies of scale in marketing
and transport are critical.)
5. Is there synergy between our client and the target? (Not really.)"
"FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM
Background
Your firm has been asked to advise on the purchase of a Korean airline. There is
some controversy on the frequent flyer program of the airline being acquired. The
airline claims that the program is an asset, while the multinational firm making the
purchase believes the program will be a liability.
Question
How would you assess the asset or liability value of this program?
Additional Information
• All airlines have introduced a frequent flyer program, so it is no longer a
competitive advantage
• Majority of miles given by airline have been accumulated by business class
customers flying on popular routes between Korea and the USA","Approach
• Case needs to be split into the asset side and the liability side
• Asset value of frequent flyer program mainly lies in locking in business class
customers who will have accumulated a high switching cost because they have
built up so many miles. As a result, they have access to additional perks such as
free upgrades, access to lounges, etc. that they do not want to give up.
Candidate should make a decision on how much value business customers
attach to these privileges.
• Liability of program depends on cost of redemption of miles and lost opportunity
cost
• Redemption cost depends on incremental cost of fuel, handling, and checking, as
well as the cost of running the program and the opportunity cost of the seats
• Opportunity cost can be minimized by managing the lock-out dates and the
number of seats available for frequent flyers
• Cost of running program (which candidate should identify as most costly part of

program) is IT infrastructure, marketing costs, and the cost of operating a phone-
in line. These costs can be lowered by using the service for other tasks of the

acquiring firm (credit card, insurance, etc.)
• An exceptional answer will use a chart to summarize the above points."
"NATURAL GAS INVESTMENT
Background
Natural gas is a large domestic industry. Natural gas can be used for automobile
fuel but is primarily used for heating and industrial purposes.
Question
The client produces natural gas and needs to decide whether to drill/build a new
sourcing point, which would involve a major capital investment. Should the client
pursue this venture?
Additional Information
• The investment would cost $250, have a 10-year useful life, and would
produce 3 units a year.
• It is drilled for and then removed by means of pipes and extracting
equipment.
• Natural gas is a relatively plentiful but finite natural resource that cannot be
easily replaced.

type of “Go/No Go” question.
The candidate ought to suggest plotting the demand curve for natural gas for 10
years: Price vs. Quantity (P x Q) for the given data.
Using the set of data points on the next page, the candidate should advise against
the investment because the average price has been declining and would not justify
the capital outlay required."
"UGLY AIRPLANES
Background
The domestic airline industry is extremely competitive and airline companies
frequently sustain large losses. Consequently, decisions that involve even small
outlays of cash are carefully considered.
Question One
The airline in question has ugly planes. Should it paint them?
Additional Information
• Most airlines paint their planes to match their corporate logo or as part of a
brand image campaign.
• This airline has updated its brand image/marketing materials, but has not yet
painted its planes.
• The client’s planes are currently painted with a logo/image dating from the
mid-1980’s in colors currently considered passé.
• The airline industry is a fixed-cost business.
• Adding passengers does not increase costs very much.
• Thus, the client should do whatever is required to fill the planes. If customers
think the planes are ugly, they will fly an airline with better-looking planes.
• The customer segment that cares about plane appearance is the vacation
traveler who travels out of non-hub cities.
• Painting planes costs $50,000 per plane, the expected revenue increase due
to painting planes is 1%.
• The client has 100 planes and total Revenues of $4 billion

Question #2
Since the client is going to paint its planes how can the job be accomplished without
idling aircraft?
Additional Information
• Grounding an airplane reduces its utilization, thereby reducing its potential
revenue.
• Airlines don’t like grounding planes even if few flights are scheduled, since
they are more likely to incur uncompensated costs if problems occur.","Approach
Attempt to discover the costs and benefits of the action before recommending a
solution.
Increase revenue by 1% will lead to a $4 million increase in Revenue, compared to
the $5 million cost, the painting expenditure will be recovered in less then two years.
Answer: Paint the planes

Approach
The candidate ought to point out that planes routinely are grounded for two weeks
per year for D-check major maintenance. It so happens that it would take 12-14 days
to paint one plane: 2 days to paint and 10-12 days for the drying/curing cycle.
Therefore, the lanes ought to be painted during the regular maintenance cycle."
"STEEL MILL CAPACITY EXPANSION
Background
Your client is a steel mill, who is considering whether or not to add capacity.
Question
Should the client add capacity? If so, how much?
Additional information
• Buyers consist of wholesalers for large manufacturing firms such as auto plants,
etc.
• Product offerings include slab, pig, and I-beams, which are commodity products
• No further economies of scale are possible
• Market Price: $3.50
• New capacity cost: Average Total Cost is $2.50
• Market demand is 100 million tons
• Market Share and Price:
Name Percent Cost
Company A 40% $2.00
Company B 25% $2.25
Client 20% $2.50
Company D 10% $3.00
Company E 5% $3.50
• Everyone is at capacity, but no one other than the client can expand","Approach
• Determine Industry capacity then determine cost
• Explore what the demand curve looks like. Find out that:
- The demand curve is not continuous, but stepped. Since you are the only
seller who can expand, you can act like a monopolist on the residual demand
(i.e. you can set the market price). However, as you lower price you will both
expand market share and reduce the margin on all of your product.
• Determine what price you would charge:
1. If you price at $3.49 you will take the 5% share from Company E. Total
profits (Revenue – cost) will be:
(20M + 5M)($3.50) – (20M + 5M)($2.50) = $25M
This is an increase from the current profit of $20 million, so adding 5%
capacity would be a profitable move
2. If you price at $2.99 you will take the 15% share from companies D and E.
Total profits will be:
(20M + 15M)($3.00) – (20M +15M)($2.50) = $17.5M
This is a decrease from the current profit of $20M so adding 15% capacity
would be an unprofitable move"
"CHEMICAL MANUFACTURER
Background
Your client is a large national manufacturer of basic chemicals facing stagnant
growth and profits. They are considering the acquisition of rechargeable battery
manufacturer to stimulate growth and profits.

Question
What are the issues they should consider in making this decision?

Additional Information
• Client is the largest national manufacturer in their product line.
• Rechargeable batteries: (Do not give this information unless specifically asked –
this is the key to solving the case)
• A high-growth industry.
• Growth is being fueled by advances in communications technology,
especially the explosive growth in the use of cellular phones and other
devices that need to be powered by batteries.
• Industry is dominated by Japanese low-cost manufacturers with high
volumes.
• Main customer base will be OEMs of cellular phones and similar equipment.
• Key success factors in this industry are:
• Ability to bring product to market quickly.
• Constant innovation.
• Ability to draw a price premium for innovation before imitators and low-cost
producers enter the market.","Approach
Two key issues to be considered:
1. Internal Issues
a. Fit with long-term objectives:
- Long-term objective of client is entry into high-growth markets.
b. Fit with core competencies:
- Required core competencies:
- Product innovation.
- Ability to bring to market quickly.
- Ability to meet strict customer requirements relating to product quality,
delivery and reliability.
- Current core competencies:
- National distribution channels.
- Low cost chemicals manufacturing.
- Commodity products, low service level.
- Competencies that need to be acquired:
- R&D ability
- Bringing product to market quickly.
- Servicing a small number of key customers.

2. External Issues
a. Competitors:
- Who are current competitors?– Low cost Japanese manufacturers
- Likely response to client’s entry into the market – Further price cutting or
innovation? Talk about game theory.
b. Customers and market growth:
- Who are the customers?
- OEMs (main market)
- Replacement market (insignificant share)
- What do they want?
- Availability (reliable delivery schedules synchronized with their
production schedules)
- Reliable product (Brand name manufacturers of electronic equipment)
- Constant innovation in products (miniaturization, longer battery life)
- What does market growth look like in the long term?
- Current and future profit margins? – Get information
- Attractive growth prospects due to growth in communications industry"
"BIOTECH FIRM
Background
You have been retained by the VP-Sales of a biotech firm. The firm has just
obtained FDA approval for a new product that will take between 6 and 9 months to
bring to market.

Question
Your task is to advise the VP on the following questions:
1. Should he hire a sales force?
2. If so, how many salespeople should he hire?

Additional Information
• This product is an adjunct to chemotherapy.
• The target market will be oncologists (cancer specialists)
• The company currently has no sales force.
• The product currently has no competitors.
• The company has a lead-time of 1-2 years before competitors enter the market.","Approach
To make the decision on whether to hire a sales force:
1. Estimate sales revenues without a sales force. In this case, the company plans
to rely on an advertising campaign that will educate the target market of
oncologists, as well as eventual consumers (cancer patients undergoing
chemotherapy) about the product and its benefits.
2. Estimate sales revenue with a sales force. In this case, the company plans to
use the sales force, but will continue with the same level of advertising as in the
previous option. The difference between the two gives an estimate of
incremental revenues with the sales force.
3. Compare the margin on the incremental revenues (benefit) with the costs of
hiring the sales force (cost).
4. Determine the costs of hiring a sales force. Key points that candidate should
keep in mind in detailing the methodology:
a. There is a minimum efficient size for a sales force. Hiring a lower number
may mean that the benefits of the sales force will not be fully realized.
b. There are fixed costs and variable costs in hiring the sales force.
c. In determining costs, consider
- number of oncologists that one salesperson can cover
- time per sales visit per oncologist
- frequency of visits to each oncologist
- geographical spread of oncologists (more widely dispersed oncologists
imply that sales force will spend a greater percentage of time on the road)
- growth in compensation over time for sales force.
5. After estimating costs and benefits on a per annum basis, project net benefits
into the future, keeping in mind the entry of new competition.
6. Discount the net cash flows at company’s WACC or other appropriate discount
rate to arrive at the decision."
"LOAN APPROVAL SYSTEM
Background
The CEO of a major bank is trying to decide whether or not to implement a new loan
approval process.
Question
Should they implement the new loan approval process?
Additional Information
• Loan application is generated at the branch.
• Complete applicant background check is conducted at the branch.
• The branch sends the completed application and background check to the loan
underwriting center.
• The underwriting center updates and rechecks the background check (takes
much less time than the original check).
• Loan decision is made (approved or denied).
• The bank is considering getting rid of the first background check and relying on
solely on the loan processor’s check to speed their service for customers. If the
loan processor does the whole check with a new software system, the check
takes one additional hour at the processor’s office per application.

"DOLLAR BILL ESTIMATION
Background
You are a new associate on an engagement involving Wrigley Field. It is vitally
important that you are able to determine the number of one dollar bills in the stadium
at the end of the seventh inning stretch during a Saturday afternoon Cubs/Mets
game.
Question
How would you determine this number?","Approach
There is no right answer to this case, nor is it necessary to generate a number. The
interviewer will likely pay attention to the following questions:
• How do you define the problem?
• How do you structure the problem?
• How would you estimate the numbers you need?
• How would/could you check those numbers?
One Possible Solution
Define the Problem:
Define all “one dollars bills in the stadium” to mean all one dollar bills inside the
confines of the stadium and not any in the parking lot.
Structure the Problem:
The places dollar bills will be can be divided into four categories:
• In people’s pockets or personal containers;
• In walk-around vendors hands or pockets;
• In concession cash-registers; or
• In miscellaneous locations (players, back-offices, umpire, etc.).
Estimate the Numbers You Need and Check Them:
When estimating numbers, there are always at least three methods to consider:
• Estimations based on simple facts (e.g., the stadium probably holds 50,000
fans and is 95 percent full).
• Direct gathering of the data (e.g., contacting the stadium to ask the average
attendance).
• Empirical ways to test, either exhaustively or through sampling (e.g., posting
counters at points of entry/exit).
First, we need to know how many people are at the game. The candidate ought to
consider the fact that this is a Saturday game against the Mets and that it’s the
seventh inning stretch. Several methods may be used to derive this number:

• Call the stadium, Major League Baseball or the Cubs organization for
attendance on Saturday games and also perhaps games against the Mets.
• Either estimate what percentage of the attendance remains after the seventh
inning stretch and/or ask stadium officials if they can help to provide this
number.
Second, we need to know how many one dollar bills are in peoples pockets’ and/or
personal carrying units.
• Estimate: How many one dollar bills do people carry on average?
• Empirical Tests: Hire someone to sample people and ask how many one
dollar bills they are carrying (how would you obtain a representative
sample?).
Third, we need to know how many one dollar bills are in cash registers in the various
concession stands. How many concession stands? How many registers per
concession stands? How many one dollar bills per register?
• Estimate: Estimate the number of concession stands and registers per
concession stand (Should they be segmented into large and small
concession stands?)
• Direct gathering: Call stadium for the number of concessions stands?. Call
concessions stands for number of registers .
• Empirical tests: Sample the concession stands requesting how many one
dollar bills they have at the end of the seventh inning stretch.
Use similar techniques to determine the other categories."
"TELEPORTER VALUATION
Background
TeleportCo has developed a ""teleporter"" - two booths connected with a hardwire over
a long distance. You step into one booth and, when the devise is activated, are
teleported instantaneously to the other booth.
Question
How much is this invention/capability worth? Value it.
Additional Information
• This is a made-up problem with a real answer.
• Remember, a value is a measure that demonstrates what something is worth.
Intangible objects can have great value.","Approach
What the interviewer is looking for: a) structure the problem, b) demonstrate ability to

hypothesize, c) show that you know how to direct the discussion, d) minimal number-
crunching proficiency, and e) pitch a reasonable conclusion.

Step A: Look at the demand and supply issues in this question.
• Who would use this capability?
1. Segment the consumers; some will be willing to pay more than others.
Who are these and hypothesize heavily on who the more profitable ones
will be (e.g., business travelers are more profitable than leisure travelers,
as evidenced by 747 vs. Concorde travel between New York and London)
2. Show your directional ability by saying ""In order to simplify this problem
for now, I’d like to look primarily at NY-London Concorde travel. Time
permitting, we’ll come back to assess other routes/options.""
3. Demonstrate numeral literacy by extrapolating how much you think
""instantaneous"" travel would be worth. If the business traveler pays
$1000 for a 10hr 747 flight and $3000 for a 2 hour Concorde flight, then
linear extrapolation predicts a 1sec transfer would be worth $???.
4. Demonstrate business-sense by recognizing that this number is too large
to be credible and propose a non-linear relationship to derive a lower
number (e.g. marginal benefit of going from 2 minutes to 1 second travel
< going from 2 hours to 2 minute travel). Provide a hard final number that
you mutually agree upon to show conclusiveness.
• How much would it cost to implement this technology (very important to
demonstrate sensitivity to fixed vs. variable costs)?
1. Each pair of booths costs $20M and laying the required hardwire line
costs $200M from New York-London. Operational costs are negligible
(i.e. ignore marketing, upkeep, and electrical costs).
2. Numerical literacy question: how quickly will this investment be recouped
based on price assumptions made on the demand side where you
assume: a) a ""skimming"" approach by which you target only the high-end
business users, and b) a ""full-entry"" approach by which you target all
types of travelers (assume that individual traveler pays ~$500 for a 10-
hour 747 flight and does not use the Concorde).
3. Show business acumen by recognizing that competitive response will be
different with these two entry approaches, but show directional ability by
postponing for later discussion (don’t forget to come back to this issue!).
4. Demonstrate the good sense to conclude that ""supply costs are not going
to be the killer in this project. High revenues/demand would swamp out
all questions about profitability."" The interviewer may ask to discover
under what financial conditions this would not hold true (see Step B for
further discussion).

Step B: Analyze the competitive responses to your entry
Demonstrate directional ability by remembering to study what kinds of responses
might occur under your two entry approaches. Note that the marginal cost of airline
service is still higher than with the teleporter, which was assumed to be zero. In the
""skimming"" approach, we steal a fraction of the high-profit business customer, which

would irritate the airlines. The lower our prices, the larger the fraction of stolen high-
profitability customers. Therefore, we might seriously consider setting our prices

really high only to take away the truly price-insensitive/time-sensitive flyer and irritate
the airlines only a little. On the other hand, a ""full-entry"" approach might undermine
the fundamental purpose of air travel. The airlines would be really upset!
An alternative solution might be to ""sell"" the technology to the airlines instead of
building the booths and connections ourselves. There are two reasons why this
might be a viable strategy: 1) if you threaten the life of the airlines, they will definitely
fight you with every resource they possess (e.g., lobbying for government regulations
against teleporters); 2) the value of getting money today from the airlines is worth
more than if you extracted it yourself over several years, given that the two sums are
equivalent. As with all valuation cases, the candidate ought to be ready to calculate
a NPV. In this example, the equivalent purchase price could be something like the
NPV of $10 billion spread over 10 years evenly."
"CENTRAL PARK
Background:
NYC Mayor Giuliani wants to lease central park to raise some revenue. The lease is
for 99 years. The client has retained you to advise them on controlling and operating
central park. Giuliani will accept sealed bids – the highest bidder will win, as long as
the use meets expectations.

Question:
What should we do with Central Park and what should our bid be?

Case Information:
• Expectations are that the buyer can build on no more than 20% of the park.
Building sites can be roughly 2-5 stories in height, though no high rises. The
buyer can put these facilities to any purpose.
• The client has other New York assets/facilities.
• The client is Disney (this information should only be given out if requested).
• Giuliani will take the highest bid no matter what the highest bid is.
• If the person taking the case comes up with a figure, tell them the client is the
only bidder. What should they bid?","Analysis of case:
First, the person should determine who the client is. This information is vital to how
to structure what to do with the park. Regardless, the case taker should come up
with a rough format of how to value the park. Setting up this format will drive out
potential uses, the value of each use to a particular person or persons, the amount
the client can charge for such a use, and some assumptions about the aggregate
fees per day and per year for each use. The case taker should also consider
multiple uses for different parts of the park. Sample uses include leave as a regular
park but charge for usage, make a theme park or amusement park, create a
permanent concert venue and charge admission, install housing, put up other
commercial or retail space. Although the case taker need not explore each one,
he/she should choose one and get an idea of how much the value would be.
After the case taker puts some assumptions around value and what to charge, the
daily and yearly usage figures should be estimated. These estimates are back of the
envelope; the giver is simply trying to see if the taker can think on his/her feet and
come up with reasonable assumptions for the value of the park. For instance, as a
regular park, the buyer could charge admission. If the users currently get $8 of utility
from a free park, it might be reasonable to assume that the client could charge each
user $4 a visit. If we assume that 5000 people visit the park daily after the admission
fee is instituted, then the park generates $20,000 a day. Multiply times 360 to get that the park is making 7.2 Million per year. Since the lease is essentially forever,
pick an acceptable discount rate, say 10%, and the park is worth $72 Million.
Obviously the taker should use simple numbers to help out the math. Also, the taker
should mention that no costs are factored in, and that the utility would need to be
measured for feasibility. Other uses of the park would clearly bring in other cash
flows, including up front capital expenditures.
Finally, if the case taker suggests a figure, mention that NY will take the highest bid
no matter what – and that your client has is the only bidder. The bid should be
something like $1."
"PAINT OR LAMINATE
Background:
A client has come to you with a new technolgy which will label bottles in a way that
makes them look like they have been painted.
Question:
How valuable is the technology?

Case Information:
• There is a limited set of companies which make bottles and apply labels. When a
bottle is to be painted, a different company will generally do the painting, but will
not necessarily create the bottle: 10% of the painting is done at the glass
manufacturer. (There are actually only 4 players in the market and it is mature;
the case taker should realize that margins are low and glass bottles are a
commodity)
• The market size of the paint and label business today is $50 billion. 10% of all
bottles get paint.
• Current paint technology provides crude images. The new laminate would create
sharp bright images.
• Each color painting today adds additional expense; the new laminate would not
necessarily be so.
• The laminate is more expensive than paper, but cannot be scratched off.
• The cost per bottle is $0.20 for paint, $0.15 for the laminate, $0.05 for paper
labels.
• An un-labeled bottle costs $0.05.

Potential Questions:
• Who wins and who loses with this technology?
• Who really needs it?","Analysis of case:
This case involves a little math and some reasonable assumptions on the part of the
case taker.
The case taker could move down the path right away of who might need this
technology. The case taker should instead focus on the numbers, and then come
back to that discussion at the end.
• Realizing that the market is $5 billion a year and the cost is still high for your
product, you could really only charge no higher than $0.19 per bottle for the
laminate. In fact, you may only be able to realize a couple cents per bottle, since
the bottlers need some incentive to move to your product. Thus the actual value
of the technology would be some $0.035 per bottle. Assuming that each bottle
costs a nickel by itself, then the number of bottles with paint would be 5 B/0.25 =
20 B bottles. So the technology would be worth about 700 Million.
• The case taker should then discuss who might use this technology and discuss
why they might switch. Companies dependent on marketing may be best suited
for this technology, such as Coca-Cola. The candidate should feel free to
suggest other ways to expand the business. However, the candidate should
realize that most bottled products are as much a commodity as the bottle
themselves. If a drink producer made $0.25 for every drink sold using paper
labels, then raising costs by $0.13 per bottle for laminated labels would seriously
erode profits. They would have to sell twice as many bottles of soda than they
did before switching. In an industry like the software industry such increases are
unlikely.
• Finally, the case taker should realize that not all painted labels will convert to
laminate; the technology is therefore worth somewhat less than the $700 million
figure from above."
"MILK LIVES LONGER
Background:
An entrepreneur chemist with a dairy bent has developed a serum for extending the
shelf life for milk.

Question:
How valuable is the serum?

Case Information:
• The inventor has an unlimited supply of the serum (not really important).
• The formula is patented.
• Milk costs $2 per gallon.
• The current shelf life of milk is about a week after purchase; the formula will
extend this shelf life to 6 or 7 weeks.
• When a gallon of milk is purchased, 20% goes bad before it gets used on
average.
• The following information can be given, but can also be worked out as
assumptions by the case taker (the latter is preferred, but if he/she needs help,
give the info in pieces below):
o 100 Million households in the US
o Each household uses about 1 gallon of milk per week

Potential Questions:
• Who wins and who loses with this formula?
• Does the retail grocer now have to supply more or less shelf space to milk?","Analysis of case:
• This case involves quite a bit math. The case taker should realize that the
average household only uses .8 gallon; the other .2 goes bad before they use it.
• The case taker should also figure out what the total size of the milk market is.
We can get this number by multiplying 50 (number of weeks per year) * 1 gallons
used per week * 100 M (number of households) * $2 = 10 Billion.
• Now to get the value of the formula, we need to plug for the price. We know that
the households will now use only .8 gallon per week so we can use that figure in
our formula from above. Multiply 50 (number of weeks per year) * .8 gallons
used per week * 100 M (number of households) * $X = 10 Billion. Solving for X
we get 4000 M * X = 10 B => 4 B * X = 10 B => X = $2.5.
• The case taker should realize that total consumption of the market is .8 * 50 * 100
M = 4 B gallons. At $0.50 per gallon, the formula would be worth $2 Billion.
• Now this answer is partially acceptable. The case taker should realize that some
people in the supply chain will be affected by the consumption reduction of 1
Billion gallons. The dairy farmers and the retailers may want some cut of this
profit. If we assume that the dairy farmers were receiving $1 for every gallon
sold, then they are out $1 Billion. They will be sorely upset to lose this revenue.
To get around this potential obstacle, the inventor should partner with some dairy
farmers and share the benefit, and slowly force all dairy farmers to accept the
new formula. The case taker should make some assumption about this cost in
order to fully crack the case (something like paying them 500 M to 1 B).
• The retailers should be handled differently. The inventor must show that the
retailers now sell less milk, and although their margins are the same, they can
now sell other goods in place of milk. Since customers need 1 billion less
gallons, the grocers can use that retail space for selling other goods. Although
the inventor may need to share some of the $2 B value of the formula with the
retailers, explaining to them the value of selling other goods will mitigate their
loss.
• After assumptions for retailers and dairy farmers, the formula should still be worth
about $1 B."
"OIL TANKER VALUATION
Background
Your client is a wealthy individual investor. He has inherited an oil tanker from a
distant relative. He would like to sell the tanker, but knowing nothing of the oil
transportation business, he needs a better understanding of what it is worth.

Question
How would you help him value the tanker?

Additional Information
• There are 3 sizes of ship in the market: Large, Medium, and Small. Ships are
otherwise identical.
SIZE CAPACITY COST (of one trip) NUMBER
Small 50,000bbl $50,000 35
Medium 100,000bbl $75,000 15
Large 200,000bbl $100,000 10

• Your client’s ship is medium-sized.

• Demand in the industry is flat, at 3,000,000bbl per year.

• Assume that ships last forever (no depreciation). A used ship costs exactly the
same as a new ship.

• Each ship is independently owned and operated. Each ship is capable of exactly
one trip per year.","Approach
• The key is to recognize that this is an industry with excess capacity. Demand
supports all 10 large ships, 10 of the 15 medium ships, and none of the 35 small
ships. Market clearing price will be set at $0.75 per barrel, the marginal cost of
the medium ship. That makes yearly profits for the client’s medium ship 75,000 –
75,000 = 0.
• How can the client fix this? If a medium ship is truly worth $0 (or at least close to
$0), the best move would be to buy out the excess capacity: i.e. buy 5 MORE MEDIUM SHIPS. In this scenario, the client could scrap the extra five ships, and
having removed excess capacity could raise prices to ~ $0.99 per barrel—or any
amount less than the $1.00 per barrel offered by the small ships! What’s the ship
worth now? This would make profits 99,000 – 75,000 = $24,000. Assuming
stable demand (which this question does), this cash flow could be discounted as
a perpetuity, assuming a reasonable interest rate (say 5%). In that case the
value could be estimated at 24,000 / 0.05 = $480,000.
• This case is less about deriving a numerical answer than it is about showing that
you can think broadly about the interplay between market conditions and value.
• Consultants tell us that DCF tends to be the only method Chicago MBAs use in
valuation cases. Therefore, it is important to point out that you have thought
broadly about the question before launching into the numbers: “There are 3 or 4
different ways to value the ship. One would be to discount the expected future
cash flows. Another would be to attach an established industry multiple to sales
or earnings. Another would be to use comparable deals—e.g. cargo ships in
another industry—to establish such a multiple. Another would be to take the
price of a new tanker and depreciate it to the proper degree. Depending on what
we find, one method may be more useful than the others.”
• Recognize the cyclical nature of the oil & gas industry. CAPACITY is the central
issue to consider. The client’s purchase of excess capacity is essentially a call
option on the industry, a bet that demand will remain constant or perhaps
increase. Know the risks and rewards of this strategy.
• In a commodity market where there is excess capacity and where competitors
have varying marginal cost, the market clearing price will likely be set at MC of
the middle cost competitor, such that capacity matches demand as closely as
possible. Removing excess capacity raises the market clearing price (assuming
demand is constant)."
"University Bank
Firm: Boston Consulting Group
Round: 2007 Summer, First
Content: Qualitative and quantitative
In Mexico banks prefer not to lend money to hospitals and schools because if one of these
institutions defaults the Bank worries that it will be seen as the one responsible for
liquidating their assets. We have a client who currently owns several universities. He is
evaluating whether an opportunity exists to start a bank that would lend money to his
various universities. There are three questions that he wants us to solve:

= Ts there an opportunity to lend money to universities?

= If an opportunity exists, how big is it?

= How should he structure the bank?
Recommended approach: The purpose of this case is to test the interviewee’s ability to
determine whether it makes sense for the client to open a bank that serves universities. In
particular, the interviewee should recognize that he/she needs to gather the necessary
information to determine the market opportunity for such a bank. The interviewee should
ask questions to gather the necessary information to determine the market size.

Key facts:
= Population in Mexico is:
oO 0-15 years old: 7 million
0 15-30 years old: 6 million
0 30-45 years old: 5 million
= Total number of universities in Mexico: 200
= Population growth: close to zero (use zero for the sake of simplicity)","Interviewer: So, given the facts of the case, how would you consider going about
analyzing this question for the client?

Interviewee: I’d like to understand a few things to evaluate this decision. First, I’d like to
understand the size of the market to see whether there is an opportunity or not. Next I


would like to analyze who are the competitors, if any. In particular, I am interested in the
competitors because they may decide to offer similar loans to institutions, like
universities. Finally, I would like to know what the university can leverage from its own
operations to develop this idea, etc.

Interviewer: That seems like a good starting point. Let’s start by analyzing the market.
How would you do that?

Interviewee: Ok, I will start by analyzing how many people go to university per year. If
the population grows at about 1% per year, this means that next year there could be more
people attending universities than space available. I would use a guesstimate of the
percent of population enrolled in universities to calculate the number of students

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

currently enrolled across Mexico. For simplicity sake I will assume that all potential
students attend universities in Mexico, excluding the percent that attends school abroad.
Age range Population % Enrolled in Enrolled In
University University
(guesstimate)

0-15 years old 7 million 0% 0.0 million
15-30 years old 6 million 25% 1.5 million
30-45 years old 5 million 2% 0.1 million
1.6 million

There are roughly 6 million Mexicans between the ages of 15 and 30, and I would

assume that they are evenly distributed. That is, there are 400,000 people in each year of

 

age (e.g. 400,000 people who are 15 years old, 400,000 people who are 16 years old, and
so on until the age of 30). If I assume that 25% of the people between the ages of 15 and
30 go to university, that means we have 1.5 million students between the ages of 15 and
30.

Interviewer: Those assumptions seem to be very good ones. What else would you need to
consider?

Interviewee: Ok, I think that I will need to figure out how many schools there are in
Mexico and how many students are enrolled in each school.

Interviewer: Sure, our client has told us that there are 200 universities in Mexico and we
can assume there they are all at full capacity.

Interviewee: Ok, so 1.6M divided by 200 means that there are 8,000 students at each
school. I might think that this seems like a high number. In the United States we have
part-time students and full-time students. If this is similar in Mexico, the universities
would likely be able to accommodate more students without any investment.

Interviewer: No, they can’t do that as the law prohibits it.

Interviewee: Okay, so if the population grows at 1% per year and there are no new
people going to university for other reasons (e.g. better economy) this means that in any
given year we will have 1.6M multiplied by 1% new students. We would have 16,000
incremental students. Given that we know the schools are at full capacity, we would
need two new schools.

Interviewer: Okay, so now let's focus on how would you segment the schools in order to
think about the credit scoring they may have?

Interviewee: I would segment them based on:

= New school or just new branch to an existing school. I believe that it is less risky to
lend to a company that already has a business in place.

= Flow of people to school: it's much more secure to lend to a school that has plenty of
students in each year than to one that has the same number but distributed in a
different way (e.g. most of the people finishing their careers and almost nobody in the
first or second year).

= Geography: We are speaking in averages. There may be areas with no population
growth. There may be an uneven dispersion.

Interviewer: How would you calculate how much money a typical school would need?

Interviewee: There are two different streams of costs we have to consider. On the one
side the cost of building a new school — including buying the land, the construction, etc. —
and the funds needed until the company reaches a state in which it has a positive free
cash flow.

Interviewer: Great. Tell me the number, or at least how to get it.

Interviewee: The better is to rely on our client experience. He has 15 schools so there
are some experiences we can leverage there?

Interviewer: Let’s move on. How would you fund this project?

Interviewee: | will think about a couple different ideas such as:

= Unilateral organizations (e.g. World Bank, etc.)

= The Government as it may need to help some private schools that focus on careers
that are not available through public university.

= Banks: They may not be willing to do this on their own but may want to partner with
someone that knows about this industry.

Interviewer: Ok, fair enough. Our client is asking you to summarize the situation. What
would be your recommendation?

Interviewee: Can I take a moment to recap all the findings?
Interviewer: Sure.
Interviewee: I will tell the client that it seems to be a pretty interesting opportunity to

provide capital to build new schools which would be at least two per year given the
growth in the population.
"
"Mine in Chile
Firm: Boston Consulting Group
Round: 2007 Summer, First
Content: Operations
Our client is a company which is going to exploit a mine that is expected to be full of a
very unique ore, and has asked us in which order his company should extract the ore from
the field. The ore will then be sent to a factory that his company already owns.
Recommended approach: The interviewer is testing whether the candidate can identify
a useful algorithm to determine the best way to extract ore from this field. The candidate
should not initially waste any time developing one idea too fully; instead he/she should
come up with a few reasonable suggestions and test them for validity with the
interviewer. The candidate should, like in most cases, be aware that he/she is missing
critical information and should identify what he/she needs to solve the case and then ask
the interviewer for this data.

Key facts:

= The field is divided in cells of equal size. Once you blow one cell there is no way the
truck can pass through it to go to the factory.

= This is a plan of the plant:

 

 

 

 

Factory
Trucks enter here with rocks
containing 1% of ore.
The output is 100% ore

Business
School

= Each cell has different ore content and therefore each cell has a different cost of
extraction.
= No growth in population (for sake of simplicity).","Interviewer: So, tell me how we might approach this problem for our client?

Interviewee: First, I would like make sure that I fully understand our client’s needs. Let
me repeat the key issues... Our client wants us to provide him with a recommendation
on what approach his team should take to extract the ore in order to maximize profits.

Interviewer: Yes, that pretty much sums it up. So, what’s next?

Interviewee: I can imagine a number of different ways of prioritizing which cells to take
out first, such as:

= Profit: Price — Cost.

= Demand: Outlook of the price of the different types of ore. If the price is low
(perhaps because demand today is lower), but we believe that this same ore will be
sold for much more in the future (perhaps due to an increase in demand), it could
make sense to begin extracting lower concentration cells.
I am imagining that this could be similar to the oil industry. Think for example about
the price of oil. The oil is in the field anyway so it’s better to exploit the places which
the least of it when the price in the market is at a low level. Unless, of course, we can
store the ore for long periods of time without a large opportunity cost by tying up
capital and space.

= Capacity of the plant: Maybe there is a minimum level we need to provide to the plant
as input. Maybe there is a maximum... this could determine how much we want to
extract in any given time period, especially, if there are penalties for operating outside
of this min-max range.

= Operational issues: For example, if I dig a hole in the ground and the truck cannot
pass through that cell, it may be wise to start at the cells that are further from the
factory so that I do not block off routes.

Interviewer: Ok, let’s assume that the points that you have raised are all reasonable.
This is a complex business and I was pleased to hear you touch on many of the important
points. But, first, let’s focus on profits. How would you define profit?

Interviewee: Ok, in this case profits would be (price of a ton of ore) * (expected content
of ore in cell) — (the cost of extraction for that cell). I will then rank each of the cells
based on its overall profit contribution and determine my extraction path from there. Of
course, we need to consider that if we extract from one highly profitable cell, but it cuts


off access to a lesser, but still profitable, cell, this is a cost of doing business under this
assumption and should reduce my overall expected profits.

Interviewer: Let’s assume that we map the field and this is what we get:

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cell 1
x=1.0
C=3
Cell 2
x=13 Factory
C=10
Cell 3
x=1.1
C=5

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

x = tons of ore in that cell
C = cost of extracting in that cell

Interviewee: Do we have any information on today's price of ore?

Interviewer: Yes, our client expects to get $10 dollars per ton of ore.

Interviewee: So, for Cell 1 the profit will be: 1*10 — 3 = 7. For Cell 2 would be: 1.3*10
—10=3. For Cell 3 would be: 1.1*10 -5 = 6. So I will start for Cell 1, then Cell 3 and
finally exploit Cell 2.

Interviewer: Ok. What if price changes? Does it change your decision?

Interviewee: Yes.

Interviewer: Why?

Interviewee: Let’s say price is now $30 per ton. For Cell 1 the profit will be: 1*30 — 3 =
27. For Cell 2: 1.3*39 — 10 = 29. For Cell 3: 1.1*30 — 5 = 28. So I would recommend
extracting Cell 2, then Cell 3 and finally Cell 1. This is based on the fact that the costs
appear to be fixed and do not change despite the overall price fluctuations that we are

discussing.

Interviewer: Let’s move on. Our client has told us that per ton P&L statement is as
follows. ..wait, perhaps you could tell me how you would construct it?

Interviewee: I would try to find out the average price, the average cost of goods sold and
then assign some part of the SG&A costs.

Interviewer: Ok. Here are the figures that our client provided. What is the company’s
break-even point?

 

 

 

 

 

 

Item $ per ton
Revenues 1.0
COGS 0.8
SG&A 0.6
Profit -0.4

 

 

 

Interviewee: Ok. The company has $0.2 gross margin per ton of ore, before we factor in
SG&A costs. So, if I divide SG&A by the gross margin I will find how much they have
to produce. In this case, $0.6 / $0.2 = 3, which means they have to produce 3 times more
to cover fixed costs.

Interviewer: How the same P&L would look like?
Interviewee: Basically, we have to divide the SG&A by 3. We are in essence spreading

the fixed SG&A costs across more units. However, we would need to make sure that
SG&A does not increase with volume of ore extracted.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Item $ per ton
Revenues 1.0
COGS 0.8
SG&A 0.2
Profit 0.0

 

 

 

Interviewer: Okay, can you summarize what we have identified?

Interviewee: Sure. Our client was looking for a framework to identify the order in which
he should extract cells of ore from a field. We chose to focus on profitability as the main
driver. As mentioned, but not discussed in depth, profitability includes the core
components of price per ton of ore, cost to extract the cell (which appears to be fixed),
but also the cost of not being able to access a cell for extraction. Once we have



calculated the profits per cell our client can draw out a map to understand which cells to
extract and when in order to maximize his P&L. Next we discussed the company’s P&L
and identified that SF&A costs are relatively significant and appear to be fixed. This
means that we would want to extract more ore in order to spread these costs across
production and increase overall profitability.

"
"UPS in Italy
Firm: McKinsey & Company
Round: 2007 Summer, First
Content: Quantitative
The CEO of a startup in a small village in Italy has hired McKinsey to help them decide
how many trucks to lease. There are different models available, but our client has been
told that he/she will need to have a consistent fleet (they can only lease one model type)
and so we will also need to identify what model he/she should lease. This company
provides the local delivery of packages sent to this village through UPS next-day-delivery
service.

Let me provide a quick overview of how the company operates: (i) They receive every
package at 5pm from UPS, (ii) a bunch of people then sort the packages and (iii) load
them on a truck where they are stored overnight, and (iv) then deliver them starting at
9am for 10 hours. How would you suggest approaching the client’s problem?
Recommended approach: This case tests a candidate's ability to analyze how many
packages must be delivered and to see if the bottleneck is the time or the truck size. Not
all information is provided up front to the candidate; he/she should be aware of this and
must identify additional data that will allow him/her to solve the case.

Key facts:

= Packages delivered per day: 1,000.

= Dimension of package (envelope) is 1x1x1.

= Operates five days a week.

= It takes 8 minutes, on average, to deliver a single package and to be ready for the next
one (“assume they deliver one every 8 minutes”).

= Truck A costs $150 per day and its dimensions are 3*4*5.

= Truck B costs $40 per day and its dimensions are 9*2*1.

= Truck C costs $130 per day and its dimensions are double the size of truck A.

= Drivers, fuel, etc. are not considered and do not make a material difference to the
analysis (for sake of simplicity).

= The case will include additional questions not addressed in the initial scope.

","Interviewer: So, how would you go about analyzing this problem?

Interviewee: I’d like to understand a few things to evaluate this decision. First, I would
like to start by analyzing the demand. I would like to know how many packages we have
to deliver and how long, on average, it would take us to deliver a single package. Then, I
would like to analyze the numbers in the context of the three truck models our client can
lease.

Interviewer: Ok. We can satisfy a demand of 1,000 packages / day and it takes 8 minutes
on average to deliver each one.

Interviewee: So, 8 minutes per package / 60 minutes per hour * 1,000 packages / 10
hours = 13.3 trucks. So we need at least 14 trucks. I would like to think about the leases

we can consider.

Interviewer: Ok. Let me show you the information we received from the client:

 

 

 

 

 

Truck Cost per day Dimensions
A $150 3*4*5
B $40 9*2*1
Cc $130 6*8*10

 

 

 

 

Truck A cost $150 per day and its dimensions (for the packages) are 3*4*5. Oh, by the
way, you did not ask about the average size of an envelope, but our client has told us that
the average size is 1*1*1.

Interviewee: Ok, so when assessing Truck A we multiply 1,000 (total packages for all
trucks) by 1*1*1 (average package size) and divide by 3*4*5. We will know how many
trucks we would need of the Truck A model. My calculations show 16.6 which would
mean we would need 17 of this type of truck. As 17 is more than the time constraint of
14 truck to ensure on-time delivery, we stick with 17.

So, this is the result of performing this analysis for each type of truck:

 

 

 

 

 

Truck | Cost per Dimensions # trucks # trucks Total cost
day (rounded) (minimum) per day
A $150 3*4*5 17 17 $2,550
B $40 9*2*1 56 56 $2,240
Cc $130 6*8*10 3 14 $1,820

 

 

 

 

 

 



Now, from a pure financial analysis, I would recommend leasing 14 trucks of the C
Model because it will allow our client to minimize the cost while ensuring on-time
delivery (customer satisfaction). On the other hand, we also might consider that there
would be plenty of room for delivering other things if they can figure out how in the
future.

Interviewer: Ok, it seems a good idea. Let’s move on. Now imagine 6 months have
passed and your recommendation was pretty successful. Now the CEO want us to
investigate any potential risks that he/she should be assessing/considering.

Interviewee: Can I take a minute to organize my thoughts?

Interviewer: Ok.

Interviewee: So, I would like to go over this problem by analyzing both internal and
external factors. Here there is a list of the things I would think about:

 

Internal External

 

 

= Need for extra drivers (e.g.: people get | "" Only one supplier (UPS) — we are captive

sick) — do we have enough employees to UPS
= Unionized drivers may shift labor cost | * Adoption of new technology (e-mail)
up in the future might reduce the need for sending
= Need to lease more trucks because packages
trucks can break down causing late = Government regulation
delivery = New competition in the city — there are no
= Insurance costs real barriers to entry, since UPS would
= Extra fine tickets than forecasted likely partner with any carrier who can
because drivers want to deliver on time deliver on customer service metrics at a
= Etc. cheaper cost

= No association with our brand, thus our
supplier can switch to our competitors or
start its own operation

= Etc.

 

 

 

Obviously, I could analyze the sorting operation more to make a more profound
(exhaustive) analysis but that was not covered on our initial discussion.


Interviewer: Don’t go that direction. Let’s think of another scenario. Now we have to
investigate sources for profit growth for this company with one restriction, we can
neither add new truck leases nor change the existing ones.

Interviewee: Ok. Let me think, about increasing revenues:

Extend hours: the trucks are already paid for the day, if we extend the delivery time
after 7pm we can deliver more of UPS or from other companies, even local
companies. That would go (impact) directly to profits.

Different packages: we may recommend to UPS to sell different (more robust)
packages to some clients and get part of it.

Pick packages: every time we leave a package we make space to pick a package and
deliver it to another part of the village or to give it back to UPS to send it to another
place

Get contract with a new operator: see whether we can deliver stuff to other company
who is in the delivery business but does not compete directly with UPS. Thought we
can not add new trucks we can think about utilization of current trucks
Advertisement: are the trucks painted with UPS logos? We can sell advertisement to
them or to other companies. Those trucks are all day in the street.

Insurance: offer insurance of packages to clients.

Interviewer: What else?

Interviewee: We can also think about streamlining operations (reducing costs). I would
think about them in terms of fixed and variable costs.

Evaluate the route of each truck to reduce time or usage of gas (fuel)

Improve technology usage in the sorting and loading packages. May reduce number
of people at the factory

Re-negotiate leasing terms for trucks

Move warehouse to a cheaper place

Interviewer: Ok, we are out of time, but thank you for the list of business challenges that
the client should assess, I am sure that some of these will lead to very interesting
discussions.

"Refrigerators in India
Firm: McKinsey & Company
Round: 2007 Summer, Second
Content: Quantitative and qualitative
A producer of high-end refrigerators in India has hired McKinsey to help him solve a
profitability problem. Two years ago the company had a record year in terms of growth.
Though they were correct in understanding the size of the market and how it would grow,
their gross profit decreased by approximately 70% and the CEO is very worried about the
situation. The client has asked us to identify what happened and what can be done to
restore profitability?
Recommended approach: This is a typical profitability question. A good way to go
over it is to break down the profit equation into the different concepts, build hypothesis,
and test them.

Key facts:

= 800 million people in India

= Two years ago units sales in India were 5 million and last year 6 million

= The client’s company builds and sells high-end units","Interviewee: Can I take a minute to think about this problem?

Interviewer: Yes.

Interviewee: Ok. I would start by breaking down the problem into revenues and costs in
order to identify the potential drivers of the drop in profitability.

Interviewer: Great. Let’s start with the costs.
Interviewee: Ok. Given that we know that this market has been growing quickly, I would

like to know whether our client has decided to build a new factory to keep up with the


growth. If that was the case, depreciation and amortization and interest on debt (if it was
paid buy issuing debt) could be putting pressure on the profit of the firm.

Interviewer: You are definitively right in your analysis, but I have to tell you that
although they have built a new plant, there is no problem on the cost side. I can tell you
that since we have just finished another engagement in which we streamlined all his
operations.

Interviewee: So, now I would like to understand a little more about the revenue side of
the profit equation. Perhaps I could learn a little more about the market. I’m most
interested in having some assumptions to determine the size of the market.

Interviewer: Sure. What do you want? If you ask for specific information I may have it.

Interviewee: Ok, I would like to know the population of India, the number of households
and what kind of refrigerators the client produces.

Interviewer: Assume 800 million people and... I am not sure about households... guess
something.

Interviewee: I would say that there might be 5 people per household, which leads to 160
million households. Based on my experience I will say people change their refrigerator
once every 5 to 7 years.

Interviewer: Sounds reasonable, let's say 7 years.

Interviewee: If I had the number of units sold in the market last year I would be able to
understand how many people actually have refrigerators at home in India. Do we have

any information around the percent of households that have a refrigerator?

Interviewer: Last year sales were 6 million units and one year before they were 5 million
units.

Interviewee: So,

Item Quantity
Population 800,000,000
# per household 5
Households 160,000,000
Income # sold Years between change Market size
Two years ago 5,000,000 7 35,000,000
Last year 6,000,000 7 42,000,000


Interviewer: You are saying that the number of refrigerators for home-use was 35
millions two years ago and 42 millions last year?

Interviewee: Yes. However, I might question whether the 7 million growth of last year
could have been in a segment not served by your client.

Interviewer: How do you know that?

Interviewee: Well, we concluded that there are 160 million households and from our
estimation we get that only 42/160 = 26% have a refrigerator. On the other hand you
mentioned that they produce high-end which may signal that the growth is coming from
the low income part of the society, for which your product may not be priced at a
competitive level or even the product not designed for their needs.

Interviewer: You are completely right. What we should do?

Interviewee: There are several options. Our client can try to use the extra capacity they
have in the new plant to focus on building lower-end refrigerators, leveraging their
supplier relationships, dealers, etc. However, we would need to consider how to brand
these refrigerators so as to not detract from the quality associated with the higher end of
the market. They can think about exporting the extra capacity to other countries where
their product offering is competitive and there is market for growth, they can start
offering financing for this particular segment...

Interviewer: Fair enough, let’s imagine that the marketing director came last night and
proposed to reduce price by 20% to appeal to this segment, which he thinks will increase
sales by 30%. Should we support him?

Interviewee: Is that all the information we have?

Interviewer: Yes.

Interviewee: Let me think. Lets denote P = Price, C = Cost of goods sold, Q = Quantity.
The general formula to make this decision should be P*Q — C*Q > 0. In this case:

80%*P*130%*Q — C*130%*Q > 0
104%*P*Q — C*130%*Q > 0

Break-even point at:
104%*P*Q = C*130%*Q

104%*P = C*130%



80% = C/P
COGS of 80% over price does not seem to be completely out of what we would expect in
a manufacturing company. I would worry about COGS being just 25%, which will signal

that reducing price by 20% is not a good idea to attain 30% more sales.

Interviewer: Thanks.

"
"Mexican Dishes
Firm: A.T. Kearney
Round: 2007 Summer, First
Content: Quantitative
A friend of mine has asked me to invest in his company, which makes dishes for the
Mexican market. He has mentioned that he is going to use my investment to purchase a
new manufacturing machine that he expects will allow him to double production. Should
I invest in his venture?
Recommended approach: Rather than jumping directly to analyze in depth the market,
the competition and/or the company’s capabilities, it is recommended that you use a
dialogue to seek out more information. When mentioning the themes you would like to
cover explain your reasoning behind each one.

Key facts:

= 110 million people live in Mexico. Assume 100 million for sake of simplicity.
= Population growth can be approximated to be 1% per annum.

= Income distribution: 5% of population top, 45% middle class, 50% bottom.","Interviewer: So, should I invest or not?

Interviewee: Ok, I would like to analyze three key areas that I expect will help me
understand whether this is a good opportunity or not. I believe it is important to first
analyze the market, focusing on its size, growth potential and trends in terms of product
design, then understand who are my friend’s key competitors and finally understand what
this company can leverage from its existing operations once the new machine is in place.

Interviewer: Good idea. Let’s focus on the market for a moment. How would you go
about sizing it?

Interviewee: There are a number of ways to do so. We can do some research and talk to
your potential partner to get some information. Alternatively, we can visit some of the


store or chains that sell that kind of product to build a market size from the bottoms up.
Finally, we can estimate that number based on the population, etc.

Interviewer: Ok, let's do the estimation based on the population. In Mexico there are
100 million people. What else do you need?

Interviewee: Do you have the income distribution pyramid of Mexico? I believe that
income will play a role because households with higher incomes may purchase higher-
end dishes or may purchase different quantities than households at the other end of the
income distribution. I would also like to get a sense of the replacement rate, if not given I
can estimate.... And, whether there are any key substitutes that I can expect in the market
in the next few years, to ensure that my estimates are fair.

Interviewer: Assume income distribution is 5% of population top, 45% middle class and
50% at the bottom. And, you can assume a 15% per year replacement rate.

Interviewee: Ok. Let me quickly use these numbers to analyze the size of the market. I
will calculate first “the stock”, which is the size of the market given by the replacement
of dishes. Then I will calculate “the flow”, which is the size of the new market.

Item Quantity

Population 100,000,000
# per household 4
Households 25,000,000

Income # of different Sets Total # of sets Total # of sets (replaced)
High 3 3,750,000 562,500
Medium 2 22,500,000 3,375,000
Low 1 12,500,000 1,875,000

Interviewer: But... Are you sure that we can address the whole market?

Interviewee: No, in fact this was only to calculate the full market size. I still wanted to
ask you which part of the market this company targets, is it within one income class?

Interviewer: Okay, they target the medium segment, which by your calculations is of
about 3.4 million sets per year, among medium income households.

Interviewee: Great. However, I would still want to understand the projected market
growth. If the population growth at 1% per year we can assume that there are about 250
thousands (25 millions * 1%) new houses per year, which 45% are of medium segment
and they have to equip themselves with 2 sets... So there is an extra 225 thousands more
dish sets demanded per year and a replacement rate of 15% on these new dishes. So, the
market size is approximately 3.6 millions sets per year.


Item Quantity
Population 100,000,000
Growth 1%
# per household 4
Households 250,000

Income # of different Sets Total # of sets (bought)

High 3 37,500
Medium 2 225,000
Low 1 125,000

Interviewer: On the ballpark, my estimation was that it was around 4 million.

Interviewee: Anyway, we are still missing other segments on the markets such as
restaurants, hotels, offices, etc.

Interviewer (interrupts): Don’t worry about that. Let’s continue with this.

Interviewee: Okay, so now, we have to think whether it is convenient for you to enter the
partnership. To do so I would like to do a break-even analysis of buying the machine and
figure out the amount of sets that we have to sell...

[The interviewer interrupts again, since time is running low. Remember to practice good
time management in interviews and take cues from the interviewer]

Interviewer: Assume that we have already done so and we figure out that we have to
produce at capacity (150,000 sets per year). We don’t have much time. What would
your recommendation be?

Interviewee: So, given that the offer was to take the money to double production it
means that you will go from 150,000 to 300,000. As this estimate represents less than
10% of the available market, his proposal at first glance seems feasible. However, I
would want to know our current share versus those of our competitors in this segment. If
a competitor already had 70% of the market, I might be more cautious about entering into
this venture. Furthermore, if I had more time I would focus on what can be leverage
from the current cost structure to assure it is a profitable proposition.

"Centralized Distribution
Firm: A.T. Kearney

Round: 2007 Summer, First
Content: Qualitative
I was on the golf course the other day with a friend of mine who owns a chain of
supermarkets and he posed a question that is still on my mind. His question was, why

should he continue to centralize his company’s sourcing rather than split it to
procurement and distribution at the individual store level?
Recommended approach: This is a pure conceptual case in which you have to come up
with a number of reasons to go one why or the other. Be creative in the way you think
about it, the case is open ended, but look for guidance from the interviewer if you start to
go too far a field.

Key facts:

= N/A","Interviewee: Let me take some time to think about how to go over this problem.

Interviewer: Sure, take your time. [...] So, why should he centralize sourcing and
distribution?

Interviewee: In order to come with an answer I would like to go over the pros and cons
of centralizing and then weight them in order to come with an answer.

Interviewer: Fine with me.



 

Pros

Cons

 

= Ability to “squeeze” suppliers by
aggregating demand

= Flexibility to change what to deliver to
individual stores based on
daily/weekly demand changes

= Economies of scale in warehouse size,
operation, etc.

= Reduce cost of warehouse by having it

= Local people can understand better the
necessities (e.g.: because of format, size,
place) for some (niche) categories

= If distributed directly to the store the cost
of distribution is paid by the supplier

= There may be some products that are not
bought at the centralized (HQ) level
because of limited size order. Managing at

 

the store level make it viable
= Etc.

in a low cost area and not in the store,
which I assume is a high cost area

= Local people (at the store level) are not
trained to negotiate. Having them at
the store level is an extra cost

= Etc.

 

 

 

Interviewer: All good reasons... but I have talked to my friend about many of those
things and he keeps telling me that there may be something else. What could it be?

Interviewee: So, we have covered most things and we are still not finding the reason...
Interviewer: Yes.

Interviewee: Looking at the ideas that I put in the pros vs. cons comparison, it could be
similar to the notion of some products not being bought at the HQ because of some
quantities asked for an individual store. What if the supplier refuses to ship to individual
stores because of limited volume? He may not have the trucks to do so in such a small
volume or he may be unwilling to do so because is not profitable to do in that way.

Interviewer: You got to the point. After a couple of hours in the golf course with my
friend I came to the same conclusion, which later he validated with his team as the main
reason.
"
"Health Care in Canada
Firm: McKinsey and Company
Round: 2007 Summer, First
Content: Qualitative and quantitative
Our client is a Canadian pharmaceutical company. Their first drug has just been
approved by what is equivalent to the United States’ FDA and is an asthma treatment.
The client has hired McKinsey to help them assess what is the right price for this new
treatment and they will also need McKinsey’s help with completing an application to the
government for price approval. The second step is necessary because, as you may know,
Canada’s government subsidizes healthcare costs and we will discuss this in greater detail
later in the case.
Interviewees should consider what information will be necessary to address this case and
ask for data as they see fit.

¢ Research and Development costs for this drug are estimated to be $5 billion.

* Beyond R&D, marketing is the largest cost for a pharmaceutical. The
interviewer, however, will ask the interviewee to assume that marketing costs are
$0 and there are no variable costs.

¢ There are three segments to this market:

1. Basic — 2% of the population — have a periodic asthma attack, use 1
inhaler/month

2. Serious — 2% of the population — use 1 inhaler/week

3. Acute — 1% of the population — use 1 inhaler/week, but attack sometimes
results in hospitalization and death.

¢ The client’s new treatment is classified as preventative. It is a pill that must be
taken every day.

¢ Regular inhalers cost $10 each. This is the common treatment for asthma.

¢ Acute patients that result in hospitalization spend 1 night/year in the hospital at
$1000 and the rate of death is 1%.
","Interviewer: First, let’s discuss the possible ways of framing the client’s first question —
how should it price this new drug?

Interviewee: Well, there are three different methods I can think of:
* Cost based pricing — set the drug price at cost and add a percentage markup
¢ Value based pricing — set it at what customers are willing to pay
¢ Determine Minimum and Maximum prices

Interviewer: Great, now, go through the steps to solve this problem and provide a price
to the client.

Interviewee: Okay, so let’s try cost based pricing. I would assume that the company has
both fixed costs and variable costs. Have we gathered any information from the client
about its cost structure?

Interviewer: Well, what do you think would be its largest costs?

Interviewee: Given what I know about the pharma industry and the extensive R&D for
drugs, I would guess Research and Development.

Interviewer: Good, R&D costs are $5 billion. What would you guess are some other key
categories of costs?

Interviewee: Marketing is usually a big cost.

Interviewer: Right. For this case, let’s assume marketing is $0 and there are no variable
costs. [Where possible, the interviewee could have tried to anticipate this chain of
questions and suggested, without being asked, the key categories of costs that might be
relevant].

Interviewee: Next I would want to size the Canadian market for this drug, assuming that
we will only sell in Canada. To do this, the population of Canada is approximately 30
million people. We would now need to estimate the percentage that is asthmatics?

Interviewer: There are 3 segments to this market:
Basic — 2% of the population — have a periodic asthma attack, use 1
inhaler/month.
Serious — 2% of the population — use 1 inhaler/week.
Acute — 1% of the population — use 1 inhaler/week, but attack sometimes results
in hospitalization and death.
Also, the treatment is preventative. It is a pill that must be taken every day.


Interviewee: Okay, so let’s assume every segment will use this drug. 30 million * 5% =
1.5 million people. However, I would expect that there would be some barriers to
switching and not all potential users will switch from inhalers.

Interviewer: Okay, so now how do you set the price?

Interviewee: I want to determine the price to break-even. For a pharma, I think 5 years
is acceptable.

To break even in 5 years: 1.5 million * Revenue = 5 billion (R&D)
Revenue = $3,300

Use 350 days/year for simplicity, one pill every day over 5 years = 350*5= 1,750 pills
$3,300/1,750 pills = approximately $2/pill
Interviewer: So do you think this price should be the minimum or the maximum?
Interviewee: This is the minimum because it is the break-even price.

Interviewer: Okay, let’s consider the second half of the question. As I mentioned, the
Canadian government subsidized medical costs, let’s for the sake of this case say that it
pays back its citizens for medical treatments. How do you determine how to set the price
so that the government will agree to pay it?

Interviewee: Assuming that the government is paying for the current treatment, I would
want to know their current spend and determine what the difference is between that and
the new drug. Do you know how much the government is currently paying patients for
their inhalers?

Interviewer: The cost of inhalers is $10 each. Also, acute patients that result in
hospitalization spend 1 night/year in the hospital at $1,000 and the rate of death is 1%.

Interviewee: So I want to determine how much the government is currently spending on
inhalers.

Basic: $120/year (1 inhaler a month), 600,000 people, $72 million total

Serious: $520/year (1 inhaler a week), 600,000 people, $312 million total

Acute: $520/year (1 inhaler a week), 300,000 people, $156 million total

Total government is spending on inhalers: $540 million/year.

Now I want to determine how much government is spending on hospitalizations.


$1,000 * 300,000 people = $300 million/year
Total government spend = $540 million + $300 million = $840 million
Over five years: $840 million * 5 = $4.2 billion

So with the new drug, we calculated the break-even at five years to cover $5 billion in
R&D. With inhalers, in five years, the government is spending $4.2 billion.

Interviewer: Good, so with this information, summarize for me the minimum and
maximum price.

Interviewee: Summarize results to interviewer and state what you think the minimum and
maximum prices should be. Make sure to note that the new pill is a preventative
measure, as opposed to the current method of using inhalers as treatment. A good
summary will be structured and go back through the steps used in solving the case. At
this point you can also bring in other parameters that may not have been discussed in the
case such as the price on-patent versus off-patent, or the potential larger international
market for this drug.

"International Airline
Firm: Bain
Round: 2007 Summer, First
Content: Qualitative and quantitative
Our client is a major international airline with flights to and from the Americas and
Europe. The company already operates two daily flights from A to B, offering
connections to C. The CEO has hired Bain to evaluate a new route. Should they create
this new route from A to C?

1 = 4,800 miles
2 = 3,800 miles
3 = 2,350 miles

 


Recommended approach: This is a typical Bain case. You can feel free to bring in your
understanding of the airline industry as you see fit. This was a real case that the
interviewer had worked on during his time at Bain. Take the time to structure your
thoughts and discuss the case.

The interviewer was expecting the interviewee to structure a framework, which would
look at the big picture that any MBA should have in mind about the airline industry. A
strong candidate would have to arrive into final numbers as well as in a final conclusion.
Some important elements were:

- First player in the market

- Cannibalization and complementary business

- Discuss trade-offs

Key facts:

o At this point there is no other airline flying from A to C, and there is only one
competitor flying from A to B. B to C is a domestic route with one competitor
Market grows with GDP
15% of passengers from A to B (or return) have C as the origin or final destination
Current Load Factor in A to B is 80%

Ticket price to fly from A to B or A to C is $600 one way

Aircraft type:
o Airbus 319 (120 seats) has a maximum fly range of 4,000 miles
o Airbus 320 (165 seats) has a maximum fly range of 6,000 miles
0 Airbus 330 (240 seats) has a maximum fly range of 7,000 miles

oo0o0°0

o Airbus 319 (120 seats) has a fixed cost of $41,000
0 Airbus 320 (165 seats) has a fixed cost of $62,000","Interviewee: [Summarize the case and work on a framework]. This case requires us to
estimate the potential market size of route A-C, the growth opportunity, the competition
as well as our client’s resources. Also, any legal or governmental issue should be
discussed.

Interviewer: OK. How would you estimate the market size (demand) for this route? What
do you need to know? I have been working with this client for a long time and might have
the needed information.

Interviewee: Although we could estimate the size of the market, it might be more
reasonable to look at the current information the company has about the indirect route. I


would believe many passengers already fly from C to A by connecting flights in B, right?
So I would like to find out the number of flights per day, number of passengers per flight
and the percent of these passengers that actually have C as the origin or destination.

Interviewer: Very well thought. It is a smart decision to start more conservative. Our
client currently flies twice a day from A to B and back. It currently operates Airbus 320
in this route, with 80% load factor. 15% of the passengers have C as the origin or
destination. I can also tell you some aircraft limitations:

= Airbus 319 (120 seats) has a maximum fly range of 4,000 miles

= Airbus 320 (165 seats) has a maximum fly range of 6,000 miles

= Airbus 330 (240 seats) has a maximum fly range of 7,000 miles

Interviewee: This gives us 165 * 80% = 132 per flight or 132 * 2 = 264 passengers/day
(one way), of which 15% or 40 have C as the origin (and destination). We should have in
mind that if the client offers the new route, it will reduce the load factor of the A-B route
from 80% to 68%. Aside from our own cannibalization, I would expect that by offering
this new route our client will be able to take customers from its competitors, right?
Actually, does the client have any competition on its current routes?

Interviewer: There is only one competitor flying from A to B, but this competitor has a
code-share agreement with a domestic airline that flies from B to C. From A to B the
competitor flies an A330 (240 seats) daily with the same 80% load factor. Also, 15% of
its passengers have C as the origin or final destination.

Interviewee: This gives us an additional 240 * 80% * 15% = 30 passengers/day. Before
we conclude that our client will be able to steal these customers from the competition,
let’s analyze the pricing points. Do you have any information of prices?

Interviewer: Both our client and the competitor charge $600/leg from A to B or A to C.

Interviewee: It is interesting to see that the passenger pays the same fare to fly from A to
B (4,800 miles) and from A to C (4,800 + 2,350 = 7,150 miles). So basically we have the
same price and potentially a faster trip. Unless we find any competitive advantage other
than travel time, we could assume our client is able to steal customers from the
competitor. I would also imagine that by entering into this route our client would have
first-mover advantage and the competitor would not enter this route if they didn’t think
that it could steal share from our client.

Interviewer: This makes sense. Basically you have estimated a conservative demand.
What else would you analyze?

Interviewee: We know the potential demand; although there is an expected growth in the
industry let’s see whether this route would be currently profitable. What do we know
about the cost structure?


Interviewer: The total fixed cost of operating A319 and A320 are $41,000/per flight and
$62,000/per flight respectively. There are some variable costs, but they are marginal.

Interviewee: Basically for route A-B the client must use an A320, but A319 is an option
for route A-C. Let’s analyze each route:

- Revenues from A to B: (165 * 80% * 85%) * 600 = $67,320

- Cost for A to B: $62,000

- Revenues from A to C: 70 * 600 = 42,000

- Cost for A to C: $41,000
I am assuming the client could use the A320 for the main route and A319 for the new
route. As we can see, the former route will remain profitable (8%) and the new route will
give a 2.5% margin.

Interviewer: What is your conclusion?

Interviewee: Taking into consideration that 2.5% margin is not a very bad number for
the airline industry and that our assumption does not take into consideration an additional
demand generated by the new faster route from C to A, the client should at least launch a
trial of this new route. The former route, from A to B, will remain profitable.

"Seattle Newspaper
Firm: A.T. Kearney
Round: 2007, Summer
Content: Qualitative and quantitative
Our client is a major media conglomerate, with radio stations, magazines and newspapers
throughout the US. They have five major newspapers in five important metropolitan
areas. Its oldest newspaper circulates in the Seattle metropolitan area. After 50 years of
great profitability and steady market, early this year there was a strong decrease in market
share and price.

The CEO has hired A.T. Kearney to help understand the new market dynamics and
determine what strategy should be taken next. The CEO is also expecting us to provide
advice on whether he should increase prices. How would you go about addressing this
question?
Recommended approach: This is a typical case for which one single framework won’t
be enough. The interviewer was expecting you to look at the big picture and then start
thinking about the profitability issue — both cost and revenue — and asking for specific
information. A strong candidate would have to arrive at the following set of conclusions:
- The new competitor targets a total different market from our client; this signals
that there is an additional market that our client could consider exploring.
- The new sales price is below the cost per paper; however, our client should look
at the potential for advertising revenues. These should subsidize the uncovered
cost of each paper.

Key facts:

* Market Share: for over 50 years this Seattle newspaper had split the market (50-50)
with a strong, but independent local newspaper. The two are well recognized for their
news quality.

¢ Earlier this year, another newspaper entered the market, building a 50% market share
in less than nine months and leaving the two former newspapers with 25% market
share each. Although the two major newspapers had dropped their prices to match the
new entrant’s, this has not been enough to recapture the loss in market share. The new


competitor is recognized as providing lower quality news than the former two
players.
¢ Newspapers generate revenues from sales of papers as well as advertisements.

¢ There is a high fixed cost to operating a news paper, which might be classified as
sunk cost.

¢ None of the players offer subscriptions.

especially what, if anything, has changed from last year. To this end, I’d like to explore
the current market demand for newspapers in Seattle. Then, I’d like to understand the
competitive landscape. Third, I’d like to discuss any changes to our client’s management
or internal processes. Finally, since we’re dealing with a profitability issue here, I’d like
to explore both the revenue and the cost side of the business.

Interviewer: That was a long list of things. Where should we start?
Interviewee: You said that there had been a decline in our client’s market share, so let’s
take a look at the competitive landscape. How has the market share of its competitors

changed?

Interviewer: For over 50 years this Seattle newspaper has split the market with a strong
but independent local newspaper. The two are well recognized by their news quality.

Interviewee: Do they still split the market?


Interviewer: Early this year, another newspaper entered the market, capturing 50% of
the market in less than nine months and leaving the two former newspapers with 25%
market share each. Why do you think that this happened, what factors are at play?

Interviewee: The new competitor must be offering either a better product or a lower
price point. What do we know about the volumes and prices?

Interviewer: These are the numbers. What do you think?

Volume (units)

 

Interviewee: Interesting, actually our client and the former competitor have increased
sales volume with the entrance of a new competitor. I would imagine the new competitor
is offering a different product or targeting a different market niche.

Interviewer: That is correct. Although our client has dropped its price to match the new
entrant’s — and the other major competitor is always following it — this has not been
enough to recapture the loss in market share. The new entrant is recognized for offering
a lower quality newspaper. So, how would you explain that?

[Interviewee should have noted the change in price and identified that this may be why
there has been an increase in demand]

Interviewee: Well, there are some reasons that I can think of that might explain this
phenomenon:
- After the two major newspapers dropped their prices to match the lower price of
the new entrant, some of their readers could afford purchasing the two papers.
- Alternatively, potential newspaper readers who could not afford the $1 newspaper
can now purchase newspapers at 50 cents.
- The new competitor captured a new market niche, one that demands lower quality
news.
Sales revenue was 2,000*1 = $2,000 but now it is 2,500*0.5 = $1,250. This represents a
37.5% decline in newspaper sales. I don’t think that a newspaper would have such a high
profit margin as to cover this decline, lets look at Profits = Revenue — Cost. To do this I
need to understand the per newspaper costs.

 

 

 

 

 

Interviewer: Ok.

* There is a cartel for distribution

Interviewee: Our client has 0.01*40 + 40%*0.50 = $0.60/paper in costs, which is greater
than the sales price of 50 cents. The new competitor, on the other hand, has 20*0.01 +
40%*0.50 = $0.40/paper in costs, with a $0.10 margin over the variable cost per
newspaper. Are there any fixed costs we should be considering or are these considered to
be sunk costs? I would expect some heavy costs in this side.

Interviewer: Yes there are, but they are sunk. However, I can tell you that our client is
still making a profit, despite the numbers that you just calculated. How would you explain
that?

Interviewee: Besides paper sales, I would expect that a newspaper generates revenues
from advertisements and online. We should also consider the balance between
subscribers and newsstand sales. Do you have any information?

Interviewer: Yes. Neither our client nor its competitors offer subscriptions. They do not
have online news either. Let me give you the ad revenues. Any thoughts?

Daily Ads ($) | $2,000 $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $0

 

Interviewee: Clearly the new competitor has not impacted the two former players’
advertisement revenue. It has also not been able to generate any revenue with ads. How
come? I also would want to consider that with the expanded customer base, why there has
not been also an increase in advertising, since I would imagine advertisers pay per reader.

Interviewer: Usually companies split their budget of ads among the different means of
communication that reach out to their target customers. So?

Interviewee: We can conclude that the new competitor has created a new market
segment.



Interviewer: That is correct. So, you have a meeting with the CEO in five minutes, what
would you recommend him to do? What will be your strategy?

Interviewee: I will tell him that he should raise the price, perhaps back to $1. Some
reasons:

- The new competitor is not a direct competitor; it has created a new market niche
of people who cannot afford to pay $1 and reads a totally different kind/quality of
news.

- A price of $0.50 is not feasible in the long run for any of the players due to the
high fixed cost.

- As our client already mitigates the high fixed cost, the CEO should think about
creating a new product (newspaper) focused on this new market niche. The new
product should be totally independent and oriented to this market. In the worst
case scenario they would make money out of printing (5,000 * 0.10) but could
certainly convince its advertisers to direct part of their budgets to the new product.

"Jumbo Jet
Firm: Booz Allen Hamilton
Round: 2007 Summer, First
Content: Qualitative and quantitative
Our client is a large European airplane manufacturer that is developing a new jumbo jet,
which will be able to hold up approximately 800-900 people. Parts for the plane are
manufactured in multiple sites across Europe. They have provided us the following
information on site production:

* Cockpits are produced in Northern Spain

¢ The fuselage is produced in Northern Germany

¢ Wings are produced in Northern England

¢ Landing Gears/Interior are produced in Southern France

The client has asked us to determine where it is most economical to assemble the plane.
Candidate should form a structured approach to investigate the components that make up
assembly, including costs and capabilities.","Interviewee: Well, I would like to look into the specific costs incurred from the
assembly process and also determine the capabilities for assembling the planes across
different locations (labor skill and supply, etc.).

Interviewer: Ok, I like your approach. Let’s focus on costs for now.

Interviewee: Great. I assume that the major costs of assembly would be transportation,
labor, and PP&E. Also, I would think that there would be tax incentives to assembling in
one country versus another.

Interviewer: Good. Let’s focus on transportation and labor for now, as these are the
most significant cost drivers. What are some of the areas that you might analyze for
potential assembly locations?


Interviewee: I would look at the existing sites where our client manufactures parts, as
well as other areas in the region that may have low cost propositions, such as Eastern
European countries that may have cheaper labor costs than Western Europe.

Interviewer: Let’s take France as one location since it is the mid-point of the four
manufacturing locations and compare it to the Czech Republic where labor is
significantly less expensive than Western Europe.

Interviewee: Well the location in France would incur less cost because the client would
already have the landing gears and interior at the facility, and would have to transport the
other three parts over a shorter distance. However, the labor costs in France would likely
be significantly higher than those in the Czech Republic. Do we have any information
about transportation and labor costs in each of these areas?

Interviewer: Well, we have determined that labor accounts for about 70% of the total
costs of assembly and transportation accounts for the other 30%. Disregard the other
costs such as real estate, etc.

Interviewee: Great. Well, since labor accounts for 70% of the cost, let’s start there. Do
we have any details about how much labor costs in the Czech Republic relative to
France?

Interviewer: Labor in France is 1.5 times higher than labor in the Czech Republic. What
do you think that total transportation costs would be in France relative to the Czech
Republic?

Interviewee: Since these parts are so large, I would assume that a major part of
transportation is actually packing and loading the pieces on a truck.

Interviewer: You’re right. In fact, the marginal cost of each extra mile transported is
close to zero. The most significant cost incurred is labor costs associated with the
loading of parts for transportation.

Interviewee: I would assume that the landing gears and interior are fairly small and
wouldn’t incur as large expenses for loading/unloading compared to the wings or the
fuselage.

Interviewer: You’re right. In fact, the interior and the gears are the easiest to pack of all
the four parts and the fuselage is the hardest (most expensive). What would you
recommend to our client?

Interviewee: Well, I would recommend they assemble the plane in the Czech Republic.
Since labor accounts for 70% of the total cost, and the labor in Czech Republic is about
35% less expensive than France, the client would save a significant amount of money,


assuming that the skill level is constant across the two locations. Additionally, the
transportation costs would not be lower in France since the majority of transportation
expense is incurred by loading/unloading the parts and the interior/gears are the easiest to
pack. It might be worthwhile to analyze Germany as a potential assembly location
because the fuselage represents a significant portion of our transportation costs. The
transportation savings may balance out the higher cost of labor in Germany (as compared
to Eastern Europe).

Interviewer: Excellent. One last question — our client knows the demand will be 200
planes per year and they are trying to determine how large an assembly facility they
should build. How would you go about figuring this out?

[Candidate should ask for this data]
¢ It takes 9 months to assemble one plane
* One plane requires a space of about 300 ft x 300 ft

Interviewee: Well, we know that it takes .75 of a year to produce one plane, so we need
space to produce 150 planes in the facility (200 x .75). Also, one plane requires 90,000
sq. ft. of space. So the total facility would need to be 150 planes x 90,000 sq. ft. per
plane = 13.5M sq. ft.

The interviewee will now be asked to summarize high level findings and make a
recommendation to the client regarding where it should produce and assemble planes
and the requirements for this operation.

"Telecom
Firm: Booz Allen Hamilton
Round: 2007 Summer, Second
Content: Qualitative and quantitative
Our client is a telecommunications infrastructure manufacturer and they have hired us to
help determine if they have any excess manufacturing capacity. If there is any excess
capacity, our client would like Booz Allen Hamilton to suggest a course of action to
ensure they are profitable and efficient.

The client currently has plants in both Minnesota and Mexico, close to the Texas border.
The plants manufacture similar products and the facilities are about the same size. The
company expanded capacity by replicating their first plant (using it as a template for
others).

INTERVIEWER BREIFING

Candidate should formulate a logical structure (internal vs. external factors,
supply/demand, etc.) and then determine if the client has excess capacity or not.
Interviewer does not offer the necessary data and so the interviewee should ask directed
questions to extract the following data:
¢ Each plant operates an 8am — 5pm shift
¢ Demand is flat or declining
¢ Client has a relatively high market share of 80%
¢ Customers are phone companies and there are high switching costs
¢ Our client recently acquired a competitor and there are very few players in the
market.
¢ The client is not highly concerned about new entrants because the industry growth
is flat or declining, this is not an attractive market.

EXAMPLE DIALOGUE
Interviewee: I would start by looking into the company’s manufacturing process to

determine if they are experiencing low utilization rates compared to the overall capacity
of production.


Interviewer: The company operates an 8-5 shift and is running at fairly close to 100%
utilization rate. However, they have considered shifting to multiple shifts in each plant
and running a 22-hour workday. What do you think the overall demand capacity looks
like in this particular industry?

Interviewee: I would assume that it is either flat or declining because the US telecom
market is relatively saturated, with little new customer growth.

Interviewer: Yes, that’s correct.

Interviewee: Ok, well, I would now like to investigate the overall market and determine
where our client sits in the industry. Do we have any information about their market
share?

Interviewer: They have a relatively high market share of 80%.

Interviewee: Who are they supplying the products to? Consumers, business customers,
or phone companies?

Interviewer: They are a telecom infrastructure manufacturer so their direct clients are
the phone companies.

Interviewee: Does our client have any reason to believe that the market share could
change dramatically? What are the switching costs in this industry?

Interviewer: There are very high switching costs in the industry. Also, our client recently
acquired a competitor so they are not anticipating any big declines in market share.
There are also only a few competitors in the industry with little threat of new entrants due
to the flat or declining growth.

Interviewee: Given the overall macro trends in this industry as well as their specific
manufacturing set-up, I believe that our client does have excess capacity?

Interviewer: Why?

Interviewee: Well, the industry is declining and there is less demand for these products
over time. Also, opportunities exist to streamline their manufacturing operations with
more shifts per plant across less overall plants.

Interviewer: Ok. What should they do?

Interviewee: They could close some existing plants, or they could generate revenues
from manufacturing products for competitors (or for companies with similar products).


Interviewer: Looking at the first option, how would you determine which plants to close?

Interviewee: I would look at the overall cost per unit at each plant and determine which
would result in the most efficient overall location. Costs could be classified into major
subsets such as labor, distribution (from Mexico vs. Minnesota). I would also want to
know if quality of product differs across any of the plants. Finally, it would be valuable
to analyze whether our client could change their plant size and configuration to generate
further efficiencies.

Interviewer: Good. Quality is fairly consistent across all of the plants and they are not
looking into plant reconfiguration at this point. Labor costs are the most significant
contribution to cost per unit. Given that, what do you recommend?

Interviewee: I recommend our client closes the Minnesota plants and increases overall
utilization of the plants in Mexico by adding shifts.

Interviewer: What are the major risks/concerns of this recommendation?

Interviewee:
¢ Negative PR resulting from closing US plants
¢ Scalability issues (can the Mexican plants quickly increase capacity?)
* Quality issues stemming from increased production
¢ Reliance on one location/region for all manufacturing

 

Case 12: Mining in Brazil

BACKGROUND

Firm: BCG
Round: 2007 Summer, Second
Content: Qualitative and quantitative

CASE QUESTION

Our client is a US industrial conglomerate, with major investments in South America,
India and China. One of these investments is a mining operation in Brazil. At this mining
operation, our client produces only one metal, which is considered to be an international
commodity product. This metal has hundreds of applications. In Brazil there are only two
other producers.

The CEO has hired BCG to help identify new opportunities for this business as well as
understand the market dynamics. He wants to know whether he should divest the mining
business or invest in an additional facility. This afternoon, the BCG team is going to meet
with the CEO to discuss our initial hypotheses. We have been provided the following
information to assist us:

 

 

 

 

 

Local Players | Plant capacity (tons) | Cost/ton | Sales

Local Export
Client (A) 600,000 $450 600,000 -
Competitor B 4,500,000 $420 2,800,000 | 1,200,000
Competitor C 3,200,000 $420 2,000,000 | 700,000

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The world-wide production (supply) of this product is estimated to be 100,000,000 tons.
Furthermore, it is known that demand for this product is greater than current supply. As a
commodity, the international price (export price) is $450/ton and the local price is
$600/ton.
Recommended approach: This is a typical BCG case. BCG often (i) uses real life cases,
(ii) presents available data upfront in a table of during the case question, and (iii) drives
the interview to be a conversation between the interviewer and the interviewee.
Therefore, be sure to engage the interviewer as you approach the case.


The interviewer was expecting the interviewee to first provide a structure/framework,
which would look at the big picture and then start hypothesizing. A strong candidate
would:

- Discuss market dynamics (local and international and supply/demand).

- Discuss the expected competitive response to any action, e.g., a price war.

- Summarize all findings in a presentation format.

Key facts: All given beforehand, but the following would help in the discussion:

o An efficient plant should have a 1,000,000 ton capacity (but, not all plants are
operating efficiently), however, from this information the interviewee should be
able to assume that therefore competitors are operating more than one plant each.

O Market grows with GDP.

oO. There is a strong demand for this product internationally.

costs.","Interviewee: I would start by looking into the company’s manufacturing process to

to look at the competition (specifically, understand the different cost structure of the 3
producers), estimate the market demand and discuss the international trade environment.
We should also discuss the specifics of a metal commercialization.

Interviewer: OK. Where should we start?

Interviewee: Clearly, our client is running on full capacity, but its competitors appear to
have some idle capacity. Furthermore, I note from the data provided that the competitors’
cost structures allow them to sell in the international market while our client does not
currently export any of the products. Our client would experience zero margin if it was
to export since the international price is given at $450 which is equal to our client’s cost
of production. Nevertheless, the local price is considerably higher than the international
price, so the producers would rather sell as much as possible in the local market. Given
this information, I would hypothesize that there is not enough demand in the local
market.
O Competitors would prefer to sell in the local market ($600/ton) instead of export
($450/ton)
O Competitors are running with idle capacity, but we know that demand exceeds
current supply

Interviewer: That is correct. But what about the international market?

Management Consulting Association Case Book 2007

Interviewee: This is a good point. You did mention that there is a strong demand
worldwide. Now we have to find out why the competitors are not selling their full
capacity. We can think of many possible reasons. Geographical distance, transaction
costs, transportation costs, export taxes, etc.

Interviewer: They all make sense, but as we see competitors are able to export some
metal, right?

Interviewee: Competitors might have operations abroad so it makes easier to export to
their international facilities. Or they might produce part of their capacity close to harbors.
Considering that the international price is much lower than the local one, I would expect
some barriers for international trade.

Interviewer: That is correct, Brazil does have some taxes for foreign products and
producers struggle with transaction costs. Let’s look at the cost structure. Why do you
think there is a difference in costs?

Interviewee: I could consider geographic location, technology, economies of scale,
supply chain synergies, etc.

Interviewer: You mentioned some important elements. Our client has only one location
and the competitors have multiple plants, each in the countryside. Our client was the first
player in this market, having built its facilities 10 years earlier than its competitors. The
industry has realized that a plant must have a minimum of 1,000,000 capacity in order to
be efficient.

Interviewee: But our client is still making a lot of money, right?

Interviewer: Yes, enough to convince the CEO to invest in a new production facility.
This would be a $400M investment in year 0 for a capacity of 1,000,000 tons with a cost
of $420/ton. How would you evaluate this investment if this new production would be
traded in the international market? Would you recommend this investment?

Interviewee: Basically the margin will be $30/ton ($450-$420) * 1,000,000 equal to
$30M per year. By using a 10% discount rate this investment will generate $300M in
total. The $400M investment would not be worth it.

Interviewer: That is true. So, are you going to advise him not to make the investment?

Interviewee: I would advise him against it unless he is willing to engage in a price war.

Interviewer: That would be the minimum price he could go to turn this investment
profitable?

Interviewee: We should be cautious because a lower price would impact the current
profitability. The current margin is ($600 — $450) * 600,000 = $90M. For instance, if we
drop the price to $513/ton we would be losing $52.5M [($600-$513) * 600,000] from the
current 600,000 ton production but generating $93M [($513 - $420) * 1,000,000] from
the new production, a net gain of $40.5M. With the 10% discount the minimum profit
required from the new plant would be $40M ($400M*10%). Therefore, the minimum
price would be $513.

Interviewer: But if you drop the price to $513/ton, what would the competitors’ reaction
be? Would they also increase production? Remember, they have idle capacity and you
don’t.

Interviewee: That is correct, but the competitor has a lot more to lose with a price
reduction. In our client’s case we found out that it would lose money as the margin of the
current production drops. However, the client only sells 600,000 tons right now while the
competitors sell 4,800,000 tons combined. They would probably reduce their production
to avoid a higher price reduction.

Interviewer: Really? So you are recommending our client to invest $800M in a
2,000,000 tons capacity plant?

Interviewee: I haven’t done the math but I guess this would be too risky. I would
recommend our client to invest the $400M and see how the market reacts.

Interviewer: That is a fair recommendation; after all they will be playing a game with no
real expected result.

The interviewee should now expect to summarize the findings from this discussion for the
client, highlighting the approach and key recommendations.

"Your client is the National Tourist Board of the Republic of Northern Ireland (NTB). The recent peace accords have and resulting political and economic stability have helped spark a resurgence of interest in Northern Ireland, particularly in tourism and travel. The numbers and the frequency of visitors and the average duration of visits have increased. While this has led to increased commerce, travel, and tax revenues, it has also placed a strain on the country s insufficient infrastructure. The parlian ent has provided the NTB with $100 million over 3 years to promote tourism and travel by making low-interest loans and grants to private developers that match their goals and criteria. On what should it spend its money? What strategic considerations should the NTB undertake? Additional Facts (note data are disguised): Annual 1994 1996 1998 est. 1999 est. #tourists 210,000 460,000 970,000 1.7 million. Average stay 2.1 nights 3.4 nights 4.1 nights 4.5 nights $/tourist/day $45 $79 $89 $96 There is one major international airport, Belfast, which has a capacity of 3.3 million people per year. There are two major railway lines; both connect to the major cities (in Ireland and N. Ireland). There are four major highways that connect the major cities. Hotel occupancy = 59% in 1995, increasing to 79% in 1998","Analyze current infrastructure use and current travel trends Determine a decision rule for each infrastructure option FACTS International airport capacity 3.3 million- currently at 97% capacity: most flights to and from London or Dublin. Most European arrivals come by train or car - extension from trips to Ireland. Highways recently re-built, but traffic congestion is vastly increasing Most Americans and Asians come by plane; few tourists arrive by boat but this number could increase with cruises. Business travelers come by plane. Largest current segment is Irish. Fastest growing tourist segments are Americans, then Italians, Germans, and Brits. Businesses would book more conferences, but there are few hotels that can accommodate their needs. Most increase in revenue comes from business travelers that bring family (demand for conferences are growing). There are two major railway lines; both connect to the major cities (in Ireland and N. Ireland). Most tourists do not stay in hotels, but stay in private bed & breakfasts; fastest growing service segment. SOLUTION ANALYSIS This question - a typical Monitor interview question tests your ability to examine and prioritize trade-offs within a well-developed framework. It's not enough to sin ply choose a strategy. Your acknowledgments must consider and weigh the facts of the case and the needs of the client. The first part of the question is asked for you -on what should the NTB focus its resources. Good answers must focus on this question, driven by the additional facts that have been provided. Clearly. the need is to ensure immediate growing pains of increased tourist traffic. Good answers should explore the infrastructure options and identify a clear strategy that accommodates both present and future needs, and should include a supporting rational. Outstanding answers explore these options and weigh the pros and cons of each, and might explore the value and return of each option (ie., an NPV analysis is always good). The second part of the question tests your creativity to look beyond the facts and determine what problems the NTB might encounter. Be careful to limit the scope of your response to those faced by the NTB. However, there is a lot of room for discussion. Good answers must address the potential for future instability: the limitations of N. Ireland as a tourist destination (ie., weather, climate, seasons), explore customer segments (ie, European vs. American vs. Asian tourists vs. Business travelers) . Outstanding answers identify specific action-oriented recommendations for these, and might also explore potential joint ventures with other members of the tourism and travel value chain."
"Two years ago a venture capital company purchased a cable TV system that had access to 3 million households in AZ and NM. The VC firm was attracted to the extremely large subscriber potential, and the potential for considerable return. Despite their best efforts, they have failed to turn a profit in the past three years. You have been hired to determine if they can turn a profit or if they should sell.","Solution Structure: at minimum, the answer should Analyze current revenues and cost structures - do revenues> costs? Analyze the market potential of the area - is there growth potential? Analyze the competitive situation and substitutes - is this product/service a winner? Provide recommendations - establish a clear decision rule COSTS: Fixed costs associated with laying cable Variable costs of new customers (equipment) Maintenance of the cable system Debt associated with fixed costs Franchise fees to municipalities. Additional information: REVENUES: Subscribers' nonthly fees for basic services Subscribers' fees for pren un channels Subscribers' fees for other pren ium services Advertising fees from commercials Commissions from shopping channels The cable system features fiber-optic to each street corner, but not yet direct to the home. Fixed costs are extremely high due to the distance between cities in the system. The debt and maintenance costs are also higher than system in metropolitan areas. The current system is only at 43% capacity (# of subscribers) vs. a 63% industry average. Low subscription rate (43%) is not attributable to life-style or cable programming. That is, people in the service area actually watch more TV than the national average: the programming offers what they like to watch. The cable company covers an even mix of small city urban, suburban and rural areas. Population is rising faster than the national average, growth is suburban. There are 4 network stations (reaching the whole area), and 9 independent regional broadcast stations. Also, 17 percent of the residents have satellite systems in operation (USDBS, PrimeStar, etc). The quality of the reception of local broadcasts: for those in the immediate area, signal is very strong. The signal is free, but those subscribing to satellite services pay a monthly fee equal to that of the cable service. It takes 10 paying customers per sq. mile to break even, at least 20 potential per sq. mile to even consider entering the market. Although the area averages 20+ residents per sq. mile in rural areas, total actual subscribers is < 10. SOLUTION ANALYSIS This is a straight profitability analysis to determine whether or not the VC firm should continue or withdraw. GOOD answers identify a decision rule that includes an analysis of: (1) profitability whether or not the venture is profitable (2) adequate return - whether or not the retum exceeds the VC firm 's opportunity costs (3) anagen ent expertise - whether or not the client has the managerial skills to make the venture succeed. High fixed costs are overwhelming the current revenues, and the current subscriber rate is low. Good answers should investigate why and if it can be fixed. Good answers might identify the insight that distance between customers is important. The rural character of this subscriber area means the sell-rate must be higher since there are fewer potential customers per sq. mile. Outstanding answers might uncover that as the cable TV business evolved, many rural residents already have satellite dish systems that afford multiple channels. What would it take to win these custon ers over, or why can't they be won over."
"Congratulations! The firm of your dreams has just hired you. For your first assignment, your client is a software development company that specializes in spreadsheet add-in products. These products enable spreadsheet users to do complex numerical analysis, run simulations, linear optimization, distribution fit, decision-trees, what-if analysis, and a host of other high-octane mathematical functions. The firm was started by an Engineering professor at Cornell University, and has grown to its current size of 37 full- time employees. Tired of programming a main-frame computer to help with his routine but sophisticated calculations, he developed a program for his work. He soon realized the market potential and began this firm to help reach that potential. Now, 14 years later, the product has developed a loyal following, but has yet to break wide open. Current users of the main product lines include professionals in the petroleum industry, financial markets, manufacturing, health care, academia, and others.","Determine a mission - what is the purpose of this engagement/case? To help increase product sales for the client. Define the problem and analyze why. Examine target segment - who uses the product, who isn't but should use the product? Analyze the product who would use it and why? What are the substitutes and competition? Examine channels of distribution. Information: Q: How large is the market? A: We don't know? How would YOU figure it out? Main substitute is enterprise systems (customized software systems) but these systems are far more expensive. There is one competitor, only 3 years old. Key difference; cheaper, less sophisticated product line. What is the price of the product? Software price is generally irrelevant. End-users are not as price sensitive. Tell me more about the product? Company costs are not important. The company is very lean and well managed from a cost perspective. Revenues were 10m in the last fiscal year, but so what? The company is profitable and growing, just not fast enough. Current distribution is through resellers - people call them to order the product (resellers sell a large variety) Most software is sold direct to customers who contact the firm. These are current users purchasing up-grades, additional site licenses for co-workers, or people who've seen what the product can do for them. Many new leads come from trade shows, direct mail, and print ads in technical journals. These programs are effective but small. Who are the users? N e don't really know, since very little information on buyers is kept. SOLUTION ANALYSIS This case involves many complex issues, some dead-ends, and there is little hard information from which to work. The key issue is the means of selling the product. The current channels of distribution are not adequate to sell the product. Good answers should identify that the product is very complex, difficult to use, but also a very powerful tool for users in specific industries. Therefore, the marketing program must educate end-users. Good answers will explore, then provide recommendations to improve channel performance. Outstanding answers may provide specific recommendations for joint ventures. Insights: Critical insight: how large is the market? Good answers should provide what-if scenarios for various possibilities, i.e.. if the key industries have been reached but on a small scale, marketing efforts should focus on finding new users who match current user profiles. But if key industry segments have yet to be identified, perhaps marketing programs should focus on introducing the product to new segments of users."
"A major magazine publisher is considering publishing a Sunday supplement for insertion in and distribution through metropolitan newspapers. They have hired your firm to determine if they should proceed or not. Additional Information: There are currently two major Sunday supplements: Parade and U.S. Weekly Combined, they are distributed in over 90 percent of the U.S. newspapers A given newspaper will only insert and distribute one Sunday supplement The supplements are typically provided to newspapers free of charge","Determine a decision rule: under what conditions should your client proceed or not - yes, if it is profitable. How can the client turn a profit by publishing this supplement? Does this fit with the current publishing strategy? Profit Issue: Determine revenue potential: Major source of revenue potential is through advertising. The format of the supplement is cheap paper, low quality editorial, light reading, gossip, folklore. Q: A re advertising revenues possible from current advertisers? A: You tell me, you're the consultant. Assumption: Current advertisers would not be interested in this format: why or why not? Cost Issues: Fixed costs: printer set-up, distribution, editorial content, sales force (for advertising and paper placement). Variable costs: paper, related materials. Q: Are there synergies with our current publications? A: No, the supplement would be a stand-alone operation. Competitor & Strategic Issues: Competition is deeply entrenched: 90% market share. Segmentation: There are no exploitable differences among the remaining 10 percent. Displacing current competition would require costly incentives. Q: Is the brand name of current publications exploitable? A: Yes, using the brand would have an immediate impact in terms of brand recognition and quality associated with the brand. Currently, newspapers offer supplements to provide low-cost (albeit low quality) editorial without disparaging their own product offering. The low quality of the editorial content may disparage our product offering (could undermine brand power) Based on these assumptions, achieving a profit would be difficult due to large upstart costs and strong competition for advertising revenues. Recommendations: Based on assumptions above, project should/should not proceed: why or why not? Entrenched competition: no exploitable or affordable opportunity to differentiate from competition. Under what circumstances should the project proceed? An affordable strategy for beating the competition is identified. The remaining 10 percent can be efficiently tapped. Placement in major newspapers is guaranteed. Advertising revenue is lined-up in advance. Consider publishing under an off-brand name to protect brand of current publications. SOLUTION ANALYSIS Good answers identify the decision rule that the project should proceed only if it is profitable, and fully explore all issues associated with profitability. These include the costs, the size of the market, the competition and its market share, whether or not opportunities for market penetration exist. The information provided above weighs toward a no-go decision. Creative answers might identify ways in which this project might be profitable."
"A major steel producer in United States has retained your firm. Recently, the steel industry has experienced record profits. Meanwhile, your client has experienced a 15% decrease in profits. They want to know why and what to do about it.","Profit revenues - costs. Identify and examine the drivers. How have these drivers changed? The industry is profitable: what is the competition doing? Information: Cost drivers include raw materials, labor, other manufacturing, distribution, R&D, distribution Q: How have these changed? A: 0 urn anufacturing costs have risen, but we don't know why? Revenues are driven by the type of steel produced, the tonnage sold and the price. Client produces three types of steel: Galvanized Hot rolled technology Produced and sold in bulk Competitive market Low margins Production in 97:1 million tons Production in 98:0.5 million tons Analysis: Clear Steel High tech metallurgy Extremely strong and light weight Difficult to produce High margins Production in '97:0.5 million tons Production in 98:0.75 million tons Seconds By-product of production Low quality Sold in bulk as scrap Loosing money Output in '97:05 million tons Output in 98:0.75 million tons Q: Is the demand for clear steel greater than that of galvanized steel? A: Assume that the demand for both types of steel exceeds the client's production capacity, so den and is not a relevant factor. Based on the production information, it appears that the client has switched its production priorities to clear steel because it has higher margins than galvanized steel. But as a result, output of seconds has increased. Q: Do the increased margins from clear steel off-set the losses due to the increase in seconds? A: How would YOU figure this out? Determine the margins for galvanized and clear steel and the losses associated with seconds. Form the equation: [galvanized tons x margin] + [clear tons x margin] - [seconds tons x losses] This equation would have to be maximized based on the demand for galvanized and clear. Information: The client has limited capacity and can only produce one type of steel at a time. It takes twice as long to produce clear steel than it does to produce galvanized steel. What would YOU do to improve the process? The facility was built to produce galvanized steel. In recent years we switched priorities to clear steel because it is more profitable. There is much room for improvement in the manufacturing process. Some recommendations: Increase the batch size of production and store the inventory. Upgrade the equipment to produce clear steel more efficiently. Increase plant capacity to produce both galvanized and clear steel simultaneously."
"American Express (Amex) is a consumer services company providing a variety of services to its card holders. Its primary service is its well-known charge card, that enables ""n en bers"" (ie, card holders) to purchase goods and services from millions of merchants that accept the card. Unlike other credit cards, cardholders are required to pay off their accrued balances each month, and interest is not charged. Recently, Amex has faced strong competition from new credit cards entering the market. They have considered dropping the $55 annual fee. What are the economics of such a decision, and should the drop the fee or not?","Determine how American Express makes money. Evaluate the pros and cons of dropping the annual fee. Explore options for replacement revenue. Make a recommendation. Revenue Drivers: $55 x the number of members (could round to $50 for simpler math). Q: How many people have the American Express Card? A: What is your best estimate? The number of cardholders is approximately 14 million (you can round to either 10 or 20 to simplify the math). No additional revenues from consumers, since balances are paid monthly. (An ex doesn ten force late fees) 1% merchant fees for all transactions from merchants honoring the Amex card. Est. annual transactions are $1,000.00 per cardholder. ($1,000 x 1% x 10mm = $100 million) Issues to be addressed: If the annual; fee is dropped, Amex loses $55 x number of cardholders. Amex would have to generate new or additional revenues to overcome the loss of annual-fee revenue. Using a conservative estimate, lost revenue will be 10mm x 55 = $550 million. Q: Will consumer spending increase sufficiently to generate merchant-transaction revenue? A: Not likely, since cardholders must still pay-off balances at the end of the month. Therefore, must increase number of cardholders to increase merchant-transaction revenue. Q: Is it possible to sufficiently increase the number of cardholders? A: How would YOU estimate this? The average annual transaction revenues are $1,000 x 1% = $10 per member. Therefore, the number of new customers required to overcome the revenue loss would be 550mm/10 = 55 million Now, is it possible for Amex to gain 55 million new members this year? Not likely, is it! Also possible to raise transaction fees: more revenues, but must address consequences for vendor relations. Q: Does Amex enforce late fees? A: No, but most credit cards charge $20 - $25 for late payments. Should Amex charge interest and allow card-members to hold a balance? Would the new revenues from interest off-set losses from dropping the annual fee? Depends on rate of interest and average balance. Q: What is the average APR and average monthly balance? A: You tell me. (use 15% and $500) If average balance=$500 at -10% APR = $50 per member x 10 million members = $500 million annually. Recommendations Based on economic analysis, don't drop the fee. It is difficult to replace the lost revenue. While some options exist (ie., charging interest on balances) the consequences should be explored. Amex could issue an interest-driven credit card under a new brand name (in fact, Amex did so with the Optima card). Answer Analysis! The client specifically inquires about the economics of aborting the annual fee. Good answers should focus on this issue, and should provide recommendations based on the analysis. Good answers should explore the issue of rival credit cards entering the market, how their product offering is similar or different from the American Express card, and the strengths and weaknesses of American Express's position. A Iterative revenues should be explored. One option is charging interest and allowing cardholders to hold a balance. Answers should address how this would this affect the AMEX brand, i.e., the consequences of becoming a just another ordinary credit card. Another is enforcing late fees, or raising merchant fees. The consequences of these should be addressed also. Outstanding answers should additionally explore the effects of competition among credit cards for revenues, and recommend how Amex could increase revenues without dropping the $55 fee. For example, comment on the quality of new members acquired, since competition is forcing many credit card companies to issue cards to riskier consumers."
"You ve made it through the final round of interviews with a sn all boutique consulting firm. Your final interview is with the CEO of the firm, and she is concerned about the yield of offers made to students for summer internships. She tells you they ve had mixed results in acceptance rates over the past two years. This year, they only have room for 10 Summer Associates, based on their size and the anticipated number of engagements. They are very concerned about having to many or too few acceptances. Including the offer she is going to make to you, how many offers should they make? Additional Information: They are only making offers at Wharton, Harvard, Cornell, and UNC Last year, the acceptance rate was 80%. Two years ago, the acceptance rate was 50%. Prior to that, they did not hire summer interns. The company is four years old.","Identify variables that affect acceptance rates. Discuss these, and how they may play out in each of the schools. Provide recommendations and summarize. Variables that might affect acceptance rates Level of interest in consulting (ie., number of students interviewing). Number of offers. Additional Information: When asked for additional info say. You're the consultant, you tell me! or -That information is not available or-How would an answer to that question affect your analysis? followed by so, how many offers should we make? - to see how they react to adversity and hostility. The firm focuses on strategy for Fortune 100 clients. It has offices located in NYC, San Francisco, London, and Singapore. SOLUTION ANALYSIS This question tests your ability to handle ambiguity. The question requires a very exact answer, which is impossible to determine given the information (or lack thereof). Good answers should discuss the variables and how these might affect acceptance rates. But good answers should acknowledge that precise solutions are not possible. The key is to remain poised and to know when an inquiry is exhausted. Better answers might provide recommendations as to how to solve the dilemma. Note: The CEO of the firm actually made exploding offers. Candidates had a very short deadline in which to accept the offer, after which the slots became available on a first-come-first-serve basis until filled."
"Your assignment is to investigate on-line ratings services (companies that measure on-line usage, which sites are most frequented, etc). Currently, measurement companies collect mountains of data that they distill into marketable information and sell to the web-equivalent of ad agencies and electronic commerce com panies. Modeled on TV s Nielsen and radio s Arbitron ratings system s, n uch of the information is den ographic-based. They acquire this data by tracking on-line n oven ents of their ""panels,"" and thus project the behavior of the entire on-line population. According to the measurement companies, panelists are recruited to be representative, so the projections are therefore statistically viable. Among the companies, there exists few measurement standards, little consensus on methods, wide variations in reported ratings, and many unresolved issues. There are five measurement companies: Media Metrix (in business since January 1996) Relevant Knowledge (in business since September 1997) NetRatings (in business since March 1998) Nielsen Web (will open its business in August 1998) @PC Data (will open its business in late 1998) Which firm(s) will emerge as leaders, which firms will fail? Why?","This is a wide open question with no specific solution. Can the interviewee analyze an industry in a cogent, structured format? It is impossible to pick the winners, the goal is to identify the processes that will lead firms to succeed. Solution Structure: Outline the variables that determine whether or not a firm in this business will succeed. Define a decision rule: under what circumstances will a firm succeed or not. Explore the variables as they relate to the firms: do they meet your criteria given the information available. Specify the firms and why, or specify the circumstances for success/failure and why. Critical industry insight: The industry is wide open; standards have not yet been developed, and firms that succeed in doing so stand to gain. Like in the case of software, the standard that is set is will be set by the most ubiquitous products, not necessarily the best product. Analog Example: Beta versus VHS in videotapes, MacIntosh Vs IBM in home computers. Regarding Case Analysis and Questions Enough facts are presented. It is up to the interviewee to choose which facts are relevant and state why. For information not presented (for example, differences in the products and delivery of services) the interviewee should state what the impact of differences might be. Here are some variables that may determine the success of the firms, not an exhaustive list First: revenues versus costs How many clients will the firm have, and at what prices? Le., Revenue opportunities: firms will succeed so long as revenues are greater than costs. Therefore, explore the drivers of customers. First, is the data useful to customers? Yes, it is critical. A large market exists. Quality of the data is important - no one will purchase data that is faulty. Acceptance of the data is most critical. More importantly, no-one will purchase data that nobody else believes or listens to. For example, everyone accepts Nielsen TV ratings solely because everyone else accepts the ratings. Can the market support more than one player? Not so far as standards go, but it is possible that some services may concentrate on specific ratings areas rather than overall ratings (i.e.. psychographic or demographic marketing research). It is also possible to focus ratings on a specific segment, therefore niche opportunities are numerous. Who can be the low-cost producer of data - this is a niche strategy that may not work since quality is more important than price - clients of the se firms are not so price sensitive. Second variable: con petition. Use the 4P s as one approach to examine competition Product: How are the products different, why will one succeed rather than another. Do all companies cover the same ground? No some do not cover AOL or other proprietary space. Methodology for gathering data is also very different, and vastly affects the quality of the product. Good strategy is differentiation - this leads to numerous niche opportunities. Price: Are prices different? No, companies charge about the same prices Place: Is distribution different? Yes, some rely on electronic distribution of data, others on written reports. Promotion: Are there any differences in promotions? Answer: If so, how would this affect the outcome."
"Imagine in the world you live in, the world is upside down and backwards. For example, whenever you open the refrigerator door, the light turns off. How can you determine whether or not the light turns on when you close the refrigerator door? List as many methods as possible that do not compromise the functional integrity of the refrigerator (ie., don t break it, or put a hole in it, or keep the door ajar).","This is a McKinsey brain-teaser to determine how creative you are. The answer is straight forward: simply list the ways in which you can prove that the light bulb works while the door is closed. The key to solving the case is perceiving the problem as a scientific experiment, and re-asking the question as -How many ways can I prove that the light actually tumed on. As such, determine all the ways in which proof can be made available. First, a light bulb emits heat and light. What will be changed when exposed to heat and light? These things could be assessed, then placed in the refrigerator for some time, then analyzed to determine differences (which would indicate the light works). Examples: Place a Polaroid photograph inside and see if it develops Measure the temperature of the bulb, did it get hotter after closing the door a while? Place a plant inside, see if it grows. Place a light sensitive device inside, see if there is a measurement (with a camera to register a change in the meter) you get the idea here. Second, the light uses electricity. The light could be tested independently to ensure it works, and then the electricity source could be tested in a number of ways. Place a fuse in the socket that is calibrated to break with an amount of electricity adequate to light the light-bulb. If the fuse breaks, the light will work. Place wires connected to a buzzer in the socket. If the buzzer sounds when the door closes, the light will work. Again, you get the idea here."
"The year is 1950. You are Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (now known as Exxon), a company that excels in the refining and marketing of petroleum products. The success of your company depends, in part, on your ability to maintain adequate levels of petroleum supply. Following national energy shortages experienced during WWII, it is clear to your company that securing a source of foreign oil is key to maintaining your supply, and hence your market share. You have been approached, separately, by two other petroleum companies to enter into joint ventures. One company, Gulf, is interested in establishing drilling rights to a large field located in the small Arabian-peninsula nation of Kuwait. They have offered you a large stake in the venture. A second oil company, Royal Dutch Shell, has offered you an equally large stake in a venture to establish drilling rights to a large field located on the border of Iran and Iraq. You do not have the resources to enter into both ventures. Which one do you choose and why?","Good answers will outline the conditions that make a joint venture workable. There is little information from which to base a rationale choice, so the answer matters little. Instead, focus on defining decision rules. If the interviewer asks a question, reply with -Explain how the answer to your question would detem ine which partner is preferable. Solution Structure: What are your strategic objectives? What are the variables affecting the decision? Determine the decision rule for whether to go or not go. Examine and compare the offers: which of your objectives are fulfilled or not? What are the consequences of joining; what are the consequences of not joining? Provide implementation and exit strategies, and other conditional provisions. FACTS: Some variables and information to consider when comparing Kuwait vs. Iraq Political stability and risk (domestic politics) - both areas, as of 1950, are unstable states. Kuwait's government is currently more stable, but the head of state is very old. Political stability and risk (International) - Kuwait does not have as many border disputes as Iraq, and both have a tradition of working with foreign developers. Kuwait invited developers into the country around 1912. Legal/Regulatory environment: Legal risk due to market instability (legal foundation to enforce contracts and protect investments)- both areas have good legal systems, but law is dependent on the stability of the government. Risk is considerable. Few regulations exist in either country. Socio-cultural environment are skilled workers available or will they be imported? In both countries, skilled labor is unavailable. Both countries are in favor of foreign oil development, but there exist elements against the presence of foreigners, and against perceived economic exploitation. Infrastructure (Ability to get product to market) - Both countries have significant access to ports and newly developed pipelines (that cross neighboring country's soil) Infrastructure (Ability to extract oil) - This is the most significant cost to you, since the infrastructure does not naturally grow in the desert. 0 il does, but you'll have to find it. Human Resources and Management Talent - your company has the talent, but lacks experience in the Middle east. Other options can you go it alone? You need oil, where else would you develop it? The costs and risks are too prohibitive-assume a joint venture/strategic alliance is necessary. FACTS: RDS vs. Gulf Both have experience in the Middle East. Both companies are comparable in every way, but RDS is much bigger, and has its market focus in Asia and Europe. Gulf is a US company focused in the US and Europe. Both seek a long-term partnership. RDS has experience with joint ventures (in Asia), both good and bad."
"Yesterday you were hungry so you bought a snack from the deli down the street. When you received your change, you noticed the quarter you received was from Canada. Today you bought a soda from a hot dog vendor on a different street. When you received your change, you again found a quarter from Canada. There seems to be a lot of foreign currency floating around. Assuming yesterday and today are no different from any typical day, explain why there is so much foreign currency in the U.S. money supply.","Ouch, this is one of those impossible to answer questions. But really, the answer matters little. Can you identify the variables that determine whether or not currency is in circulation? Think of circulation like a process. There is stuff going in (and people putting it there) and stuff going out (people taking it out), and some activity in the middle. The solution should bok at why and how foreign currency goes into circulation, and why and how it is (or isn't) ren oved. A Iso, what happens to the currency while it circulates? Solution Structure Set up the question as a process with inputs, activity, then outputs. Examine the variables for inputs. Examine the activity. Examine the variables for outputs. Draw insights. One Example of examining inputs and outputs: Inputs: Why and how foreign currency enters the US system? People bring it from other countries and spend it (shop keepers don't notice, som etin es). This is true particularly for Canada - currency is very similar to US, and proximity Inputs: What prevents foreign currency from entering? Formal mechanism exists - people usually exchange currencies. Unlike some economies that accept US S, the US merchants frown upon foreign currency. Activity: What happens to the currency while in circulation? People get it, but don't want it, so they spend it first- this increases its circulation. This increases the visibility of foreign currency. Or people/merchants get it, and remove it. Outputs: What keeps it in circulation? The activity-people don't want to hold it. So they spend it first. Outputs: Why does it leave circulation? Banks receive it and remove it rather than re-circulate it; merchants give it to banks."
"Your client is the premier direct marketing firm in the United States. This firm also owns divisions dealing with software development, marketing research, hotels, car rentals, real estate and related, tax and financial advisory services, and many others. Your client is confident these subsidiaries achieve considerable overall synergy and provide the parent with expanded opportunities for direct marketing. Your client is also confident the business fundamentals are very sound. The problem they face is that their stock price has been seriously affected by a recent accounting scandal. Although the accounting problems have been cleared up, investors are wary. In its membership business, your client markets memberships in shopping, travel, auto, credit protection, and other personal services. It does so by off-branding its products to banks, credit unions, credit cards, clubs, and many other organizations. Its primary source of revenues in this business are membership fees. Its distribution channels are direct mail, telemarketing, the Internet, and America Online. The Interactive division also operates a number of E-commerce sites that generate memberships, and some advertising dollars. Management has placed a number of important initiatives on hold due to lack of financial resources, and due to a lack of management focus resulting from recent problems.","Additional facts to be divulged only if pertinent questions are asked: The subsidiaries are recent acquisitions, most within the last two years. The company as a whole formed as the result of a merger between two equal firms. The business fundamentals are very sound; but investors may not believe the numbers. The core business is memberships (selling the auto, travel, shopping, etc, service products). The core competency is effectively leveraging subsidiaries and marketing partners for cross-marketing opportunities to sell memberships; these are yet untapped due to diversion of management focus. There is competition within sub-categories (i.e.. your client competes with AAA for auto clubs services) but little competition at the scale at which the client operates; there are few players in the national market. Prices of membership services are stable (recent price increases did not affect membership flow). Membership flows (how many people join or quit) have remained constant; memberships are increasing rapidly. The current situation is such that the individual pieces of the firm are more valuable than the firm as a whole. Le., the firm is currently undervalued. But this is due to a lack of investor confidence in the numbers produced by the company resulting from the recent problems. Solution Structure: Determine what drives investor confidence. A ssess the client's situation with respect to these variables. Determine what the client can do to affect these variables and offer options. What drivers affects investor confidence? good management team in place - yes, now anyway. independent audits to ensure data is accurate - yes, completed. prospect for a good return on investment - absolutely, if you believe the numbers. therefore earnings that exceed expectations make a good investment - low stock price is a buying opportunity. or undervalued assets - particularly the software and interactive divisions. market climate in general. What has management done with respect to these drivers; what can management do? The Chairman resigned, as did several senior executives in the wake of the accounting scandal. Independent auditors completed a forensic analysis of the books - the books are now solid. The CEO has begun meeting with investors to sell a new strategic plan. The New plan involves spinning off the software, interactive, and other profitable divisions to enable the company to focus on key businesses. This is a tricky case, because there are no obvious actions left out - most of what can be done is being done and being done well (excluding radial steps that make little economic sense). The key is capital market behavior, not the client. The market (these days) rewards Internet based companies, but has failed to perceive the value in your client's interactive and software divisions. A spin-off followed by an IPO may result in enough cash to fuel further investments. Action, perhaps, will restore overall investor confidence."
"Your client is a start-up venture in Southern California. They market a single tanning lotion product to beach- goers from San Diego to Los Angeles. Although sales volume is large, it has not reached anticipated levels. You have been hired to find out why, and what can they do about this problem. This is the con pany s second sunn er in business.","Additional Information: Answer only if directly asked, or answer-What do you think? or-Why is that in portant? Why start the business? They have conducted extensive market research and have found that their product should do quite well. There are currently no other products targeting the Hawaiian Cocoa butter segment. The product did quite well with consumers in focus groups that were conducted prior to launch. These focus groups are representative of the target market, and indicates a real market need for this product. The goal was to attain a 5 percent market share - sales at this level would result in profitability. Tell me about their operation? The operation is three people - partners. They handle marketing (including distribution) and finances. Production is out- sourced to a local manufacturer that is reliable and cheap. Tell me about the market? The market is quite fragmented, with no dominant player. Coppertone, the leading beand, has a 15% market share. There are at least 10 different brands competing in several lotion/oil sub-categories. Tell me about their pricing and positioning? The target market is people who purchase sun tanning products at the beach. The positioning is Hawaiian cocoa butter. This is a premium product, and is priced in the middle of the high-end. Coppertone, a more expensive brand, is the leading seller. Tell me About Distribution? The product is sold exclusively at bungalows proprietor owned and operated walk-up shacks on the beach that typically sell soda, snacks, and basic products to beach goers. The product sits on the shelf, and buyers see it and select it. There are no additional shelf promotions. One partner drives up and down the beaches refilling stock. These bungalows do not charge slotting fees, while drug stores and grocery stores do. Their lack of sophistication makes little opportunity to provide incentives to have them push the product. Tell me about promotions? Brand awareness was built through sponsorship of beach volleyball tournaments. There are no other promotions. All signs, including follow-up market research, indicate this has been successful. How have they been doing? The 5% market share goal was reached, but estimates projected at least 7%. They sell out of their product at each location the product is available. In fact, the product sells very well. The firm is very profitable, but could be more so if sales attained projected levels. Solution Analysis: This tests your detective abilities. The answer is small and specific - can you find it? Use the 4 P's, and don't give up so easily. Ask, what are the conditions necessary for high sales? (1) There must be buyers for the product, (2) the price must be right, (3) the product must be available. In this case, the product was not available so people were not buying it. Solution? Make it available. Problem solved. The key to this problem is distribution. Remember that this is a profitable firm. Their problem is not economics, segmentation, competition, price, promotions, or the product it's distribution. Specifically, it is the delivery schedule of the product. The product sells out at each location, but it is some time before the shelves are re-filled. An easy solution is to re-fill and check the bungalows more frequently. Future considerations may entail a look at promotions and greater distribution, but for now the client is only interested in one problem meeting projected sales volume."
"Your client is Johnson Wax, a large consumer products firm located in Racine, Wisconsin (and is also the principle sponsor of a very prestigious business school). As a by-product of one of their manufacturing processes, they have discovered a revolutionary new liquid that seems to have a variety of uses. It is completely harmless, non-toxic, odorless, disposable, and dissolves in water with no environmentally damaging qualities. It has many useful functions. It makes house plants shine, and is possibly good for them. It polishes wood, leather, and other furniture very safely. As a dietary supplement, it provides protein and carbohydrates, and could make an excellent pet food or baby-food supplement.

A bank that loans to real estate developers has a lower than industry average return. You are asked to help improve profitability. How would you approach this problem?,"Bank borrows from Fed at a rate of 6% and lends money at 10%. Major source of loss are the loan officers at the rate of $200,000 each per year. Each officer spends the same amount of time on each loan, no matter what the size. Variable costs increase with the number of loans. The bank is taking too many small loan applications. They should reduce the amount of time on small loans, increase the rate for small loans or exit the small loan business entirely. What is the breakeven volume of loans each officer must process? Revenues + spread. Costs are split into variable costs (chargeoffs) and fixed costs (salary). Given that the spread is 10% - 6%-4% assume charge off is 3% (interviewee may have to estimate). Therefore at breakeven: 4% x=3% x + $200,000 X = $20 million. = volume of business each person should handle each year."

The structure of the retail gasoline business is as follows: Mobil owns the gas stations while the Station manager/owner owns the business. Mobil sells gasoline to the station at the wholesale price (DTW) while the station manager/owner sets the street price. Mobil makes a profit of about 10 cents per gallon.","Key Points by Interviewee: Product: Gas is a commodity. Promotion: Done nationally, not this group. Distribution: Fairly automatic. Price: Mobil does not set street price. How is street price determined? Recommendations: Mobil wants the street price as low as possible (close to DTW), which increases volume. But how does station make a profit? Answer: Convenience store and auto care are high margin (but low volume), sales force should help Station owner to set up profitable convenience store and low gas price to attract volume."

"Your client is an international manufacturer of electronic equipment for industrial customers. The R & D department has developed a new product-- a device that could replace all energy costs in a residence (electric, gas, etc.) using solar technology. The estimated price to the customer would be $5,000 per house. The R & D department says the pay back time for a house would be 2-3 years. With an estimated investment of $100 million to commercialize the system what is the potential market in the US? How would you estimate the percent of market to install the device?","Further facts by interviewer: A survey shows 30% of home owners are interested. How do we test this? (1) hypothesis: residential market. There are 50 million houses in the US(potential market size). NPV analysis looks good. (2) market survey Recommendations: 1) pre-order risky 2) look at similar energy saving devices (new refrigerators, showerheads, etc) see what is the percentage of people who actually bought it after showing interest. The student was then told that people don't buy energy saving devices. They would rather spend their money some other way. Market therefore is small and the project was stopped."

The quoting company thinks it might be a political move, since they have just been purchased by one of their client's major competitors. What should they do?","Hypothesis testing 1) hypothesis 2) how do we test 3) what are the implications Key questions by interviewee: Is the action by the client political? (I expect the answer to be no) how to test? Ask them! (Answer was NO, but because it is more economical for the client to do it themselves) Was action done for economic reasons? Company claims no. I think yes, because otherwise the client wouldn't leave. Answer was yes, but only because of the huge scale of the client. It was economical, but only for that client. Given this, what would you worry about? Worry about 3 things: 1) improving technology will move cost frontier inward. 2) consolidation in industry will create more large clients that might make their own Systems 3) client might now sell their own system and we would have competition. Comments: #1, #2 actually happened. My recommendation was they change pricing scheme to give ""bulk discounts"" to large clients so that it didn't become worthwhile for them to split off- but they could get more value from smaller clients."

"This case tests your creativity. There is no real answer except to list all the possible ways in which you can dispose of the couplers. Making a decision tree is not a bad idea. A few examples: Make them into Christmas ornaments Sell them as decorations Use them as art supplies for sculptures Sell them as toys: dolls, leggo-type things, etc Make them into furniture accessories, e.g. candle-holders For every option you con pose, you should discuss segn entation (ie., target consumers), why they'd buy it, price point, promotional strategy and distribution.","Tarragon was a start-up high-technology firm seeking to take advantage of the growth in fiber optics.

"Note to interviewer Play the role of CEO-be VERY American. The heart of the problem is that the American managers assigned abroad were unprepared to adequately deal with different business environments.

Timber company prices are the same as their competitors. Use same equipment. Have the same labor skills. Wood is the same quality. There is not much of a transportation difference between the forests, the mills, and the point of sales On average, the timber company has thicker trees in their forests than their competitors. They can get a higher yield for the same amount of processing time, meaning a lower processing cost per unit.","You have been hired by a Canadian timber company that processes trees from the forest to timber products (boards, etc.).

"This case obviously tests your analytical skills. Do not answer the question without paper or calculator to impress the interviewer if your math skills are poor, since this strategy could easily backfire, making you look stupid. This case is straightforward, but make sure that you have all the information necessary to develop an answer. Case Information provided during questioning: Cost of branch bank background check = $100/loan (eliminate this cost with the proposed system). Processor's labor hour costs $60 (at branch and at processing office). Number of loan applicants is only 1,000 per year. Average value of loan is $10,000. The proposed processing program has a 40% acceptance rate. Additional cost of new program is $50 per loan applicant. The original loan processing system has 10% bad loans. The proposed system has 5% bad loans (it is more discriminating). You should calculate a comparative profit per year for the original and proposed Systems. Here's an example: Original System: (1000 applications) x (0.45 loans per application) x ([90% good loans x $0.20 per dollar for a good loan) - (10% bad loans x $0.50 per dollar for a bad loan)] x ($10,000 per loan) = (450 loans) x ($0.13 expected per loan dollar) x ($10,000 per Loans) = $585,000 expected profit But this method costs an additional $100 per loan application: profit = $585,000 - (1000 applications) x ($100/application) = $485,000 comparative profit Proposed System: (1000) x (0.4) x [(95% x $0.20) - (5% x $0.50)] x ($10,000) = $660,000 of profits But, there's an additional cost of 1 hour per application at the processing office profit = $660,000-[($60/hr) x (1 hr/applic) x (1000 applic/yr)] = $600,000 And there's the cost of the new program: profit = $600,000 - ($50/applic) x (1,000 applic) = $550,000 of total comparative profit Based on the raw data, the bank should progress with the new system. However, you need to discuss whether the bank can make the change. Mention any retraining and system installation costs that are necessary to change the system, and don't forget to evaluate the cost of the new system itself. Also you may want to mention that a faster loan processing speed may help the bank get more business.","A bank has a loan issuing operation that requires the following steps: loan application generation at branch bank complete applicant background check at branch bank send application and background check to loan processing office update/recheck background check (takes much less time than original check) loan is approved or denied The bank is considering getting rid of the first background check and only relying on the ban processor s check to speed their service for customers. If the loan processor does the whole check with a new software system, the check takes 1 additional hour at the processor's office per application. The average profit margin per loan over time is $0.20 per dollar loaned for a ""good"" loan (loan is repaid) The average marginal loss per loan over time is $0.50 per dollar loaned for a ""bad"" loan (loan is not repaid) 50% of the applicants pass the first background check 90% pass the second Should the bank proceed with the new system?"
"A good way of attacking this case is to find out where the parent company has upstream operations geographically and then analyze the suppliers in each region and across the regions. The case interviewer liked this approach and allowed me to concentrate on one type of supplier in particular, the suppliers of drilling equipment. Case Information provided during questioning: 1. The parent company has upstream companies in four regions: Asia, Europe, the U.S., and Africa 2. There are three suppliers that have a presence in all four regions (companies A.B, and C) 3. The upstream companies and the top two low cost suppliers in each region are: Asia- 10 upstream companies, 4 suppliers, rankings: A,B Africa 4 upstream companies, 4 suppliers rankings: A.B Europe- 10 upstream companies, 6 suppliers, rankings: B.C U.S.- 6 upstream companies, & suppliers rankings: C,B Like all other cases, there is no one answer. Instead you should mention several things: look at the strengths of each supplier (do they have specific equipment that gives them an advantage even though they may not be low cost) will the suppliers reduce their prices if the parent company offers a larger volume of business or a sole-sourcing agreement, and do the suppliers have the resources for a larger volume if A is chosen as sole supplier to the 10 companies in Asia and C for the 6 in the U.S.. can you transfer the cost cutting ideas between the two companies to receive further cost reductions?","A large oil and gas company that has operations worldwide is divided into three business segments: upstream, downstream, and chemicals. Upstream involves drilling and extracting oil, downstream is refining the product into gas and selling it at stations, and chemicals is producing petroleum-based products. The upstream business segment is divided into approximately 30 companies worldwide that fall under the parent company's umbrella of businesses. These companies use numerous suppliers and the parent company would like to cut supplier spending and, in particular, the parent company would like to know whether they are using the cheapest suppliers in all cases."
"Determine a decision rule. Identify the key factors for consideration. Investigate the pros and cons of these factors. Make a recommendation. Information (provide only if asked): The competitive environment is very fragmented in the niche portion of the industry. MPL has been profitable each year, growing 30% annually. MPL has very little debt, and owns all its equipment ($30,000 bank loan for equipment). Customer relationships are critical: MPL has a solid customer base. MPL has a customer base of about 10 firms = 90% of business are repeat customers. Relationships are not steady-client needs vary from time to time, job sizes vary considerably. Business is strong but variable: customer demand comes and goes in waves, unpredictable. Offering turn-key solutions would not smooth the production cycle. MPL specializes in filling niche needs; small lot sizes, unusual delivery schedules. MPL is currently not seeking new clients, lacks the capacity to service new clients. MPL lacks the resources (skills) to forecast demand. There is not enough skilled labor in the area to increase capacity-why they're turning customers away. Offering turn-key solutions would require an increase in capacity. Parts supplies are plentiful; discounts are possible for bulk purchases. GOOD answers should uncover: Advantages of turn-key: more S. more customers. Disadvantages: requires greater capacity, would not smooth operational cycle (demand is highly variable), large investment in inventory is financially unfeasible (payback would only occur over time), MPL lacks scale. Identify steps to mitigate demand issues. Increasing in capacity is a -step function, not linear. Discuss issue of resources (skilled labor).","MPL is a seven-year old contract-manufacturing firm located in Ithaca, New York. The founder and President, Shane French, has found a niche in the contract manufacturing space by providing his customers highly customized service, particularly with respect to production schedules and small lot sizes. Contract manufacturing is, for example, placing microelectronics on printed circuit boards (a.k.a. motherboards) for such components as computers, lasers, and electronic items. Currently, customers provide MPL with parts inventory, and MPL performs the assembly. French investigated the field and is considering offering turn-key solutions. That is, providing ready-made boards for clients (based on customer specifications). This would require an investment in inventory, but MPL could command a 20% mark-up on parts alone. This is how many contract manufacturing firms grow revenues. Should MPL offer turn-key solutions?"
"You are the CEO of a Fortune 500 high-technology manufacturing firm. Your core competence is product development and innovation to serve a variety of consumer and business segment needs. It is budget time again, and the CFO has presented a budget that meets most of your goals. It is almost complete, except one area remains completely blank. After numerous discussions with the board and other senior management, you have agreed to set up a competitive analysis shop (i.e., a staff devoted to gathering and analyzing data relevant to competitors and the market). What percent of the budget should you devote? As the CEO, you have complete control as to size, scope, and mission of this shop.","Background, but only if specifically asked. The firm manufacturers over 100 high-technology products that serve a variety of consumer and business segments. This company is the leading player (or #2) in each product line in which its established products compete. In some products, this firm is the low-price provider, in other products this firm pursues a differentiation strategy. There are several new products and research products underway (not yet to market). The company competes with many other firms in many segments. This company competes with no single competitor across the board. Background if asked: Why competitive analysis?

You've been hired by the CEO of a department store that has numerous locations in a major metropolitan area. She needs to increase the store s earnings over the next year and has requested your help. Relevant Information: 20 locations in the metropolitan and surrounding suburban areas (they are present in every shopping mall). The population growth of the city is flat Overall store revenue has declined slightly They recently hired a consulting firm to streamline the back-room costs How can you help?,"Revenues have decreased for a reason The streamlined costs may have caused revenue to falter The revenue per store may differ - why? Increased competition Different consumer buying trends? Start with Cost/Revenue Drivers: Costs: CGS Personnel/OH/SG&A Inventory holding costs, levels Cost of debt other?? Revenues: # of people shopping Amount of purchase-5$ Frequency Prices Other?? You learn there is nothing drastically different (overall), so you turn to the individual store level. Questions: Are certain stores more profitable than others?- A: Yes. Do the higher performing stores have any common characteristics such as size, product mix, consumer demographics? A: Yes, suburban stores are more profitable then urban stores No, the product mix is the same at all stores. Yes, the demo's are different by store Assumptions: Product Mix: The product mix may be more suitable and more profitable for suburban stores The competition may be lower in the suburban areas (turns out not to be true) The income level may be higher in the suburban areas What products are most profitable? A: appliances, tools, TV, Stereo, jewelry - big ticket items. What products are less profitable? A: Clothing shoes, household items - low ticket items Store by Store sales/Demo's: Assessment: Do suburban stores sell more big ticket items? A: Yes What do the urban stores sell? A: clothing household items, minor appliances Are the demographics better suited for the mix in the suburbs? A: Yes, higher income Due to the identical product mix at each store and the varied profitability by item, suburban stores are outperforming urban stores. Hence, the urban stores are hindering earnings. Potential Recommendations: Re-configure the product mix by store (no sense holding excess inventory) Assess the impact of the urban stores and determine the ramifications of closing them"
"Hammerjack is a regional chain of ""local hardware stores"" located in numerous neighborhood strip malls and shopping centers.

"Our consulting firm has been retained by a major bank to help improve the profitability of their largest credit card offering Their card (in the same class as a Visa or Mastercard) provides average returns in comparison to the industry, however, our client believes it can become more profitable.

Assumption: Customers use the card differently, there may be different customer segments based on the balance held, how quickly balances are paid off and the ""need"" for the card Case Interviewer suggests there are three Distinct categories 1. Payoff in full every month 2. Hold small debt for short periods of time 3. Hold heavy debt for long periods of time (basically pay off the interest) -80% of our revenue He/she then asks how you would tailor card services to each of these groups Recommendations: Pay In Full Monthly Provide numerous services Charge high monthly fee (detailed reports, little kudos) Key Issues: Hold Small Debt Short Term Increase the APR slightly Decrease the annual fee Hold Heavy Debt Long Term Waive the annual fee Increase their credit limits Cash back programs, points Access to cash advance, etc. These heavy debt card holders are the key to our profitability, it is imperative to get them to sign up for the card (no annual fee), use the card (cash back, point systems) and run up debt (automatic credit limit increases).

"You've been hired by the Kraft Desserts Division Manager to help solve a problem with Cool Whip (the non-dairy dessert topping). Cool Whip has been a complete cash cow for Kraft. It has an 80% share of market, low production costs and extremely high margins. Sales of Cool Whip have been flat for the past three years despite aggressive sales efforts. The divisional manger believes sales have peaked (80% share) and is ready to sit back and milk the profits. Before presenting his recommendation to the company president he hired you to determine if there are: 1) Opportunities to increase revenues in the US 2) Opportunities to enter a foreign market Additional Information: Cool Whip is 90% air, 10% water and chemicals.

"Frank's cheese company has been producing very high quality cheese for distribution and sales in the upper East Coast for over thirty years. Their main competition over these thirty years comes from Joe's cheese company, which also produces very high quality cheese. These two competitors have had a friendly rivalry over time and each holds about 30% share of market. Recently, Frank and Joe have seen their profits drop. Prank blames the decline in profits on increased advertising and promotional spending. You have just a few minutes to determine if Frank is correct and suggest solutions. How do you proceed?","Solution Structure: Quick check for changes to the costs or revenues Analysis of competition, Joe and other Analysis of other potential problems Cost Driver Assumptions: Any changes in: Dairy products (raw materials), production costs, distribution costs, marketing costs, other? A: No major changes except for an increase in promotional costs (couponing and retail price reductions) Revenue Driver Assumptions: Q: Any changes in: Price, number of accounts, sales levels, type of cheese sold, quality of cheese? A: Have taken periodic price reductions; No major changes. Assumptions: Frank has increased promotional spending and reduced prices. Most likely due to an increase in competitive pressure. Have we seen increased competition? A: Yes, many of our accounts are offering private label cheeses at half our retail price What do we know about the private label cheese? Quality?, Consumers? A: Lower quality than Frank's two consun er segn ents: Those who do a lot of home cooking and use only Frank's or Joe's, and those who just stop in and pick up a block of cheese. Why have we been discounting? Are we losing our loyal customers? A: No. We're just under a lot of pressure from the retailer to match prices. Issues: Due to competitive pressure from private label, Frank and Joe have taken periodic price reductions. This has hurt their margins and may also cause them to lose their loyal customers (lose high quality brand image). Recommendations: Maintain premium price levels for Frank's current line of high quality cheese. Manufacture a lower cost product under a different brand name to compete with private label brands. Utilize advertising revenues to communicate the benefit of using high quality cheese."
Our client is a major entertainment company on the West Coast. One of their divisions is a leading home retailer. During the late 80s and early 90s this division had a great run-opening 4000 stores and realizing considerable profits. In the last two years both growth and profit have declined substantially. You have been brought in by the CEO to assess the situation and provide recommendations. Background: 0 ur clients division is not unlike a chain of Blockbuster video stores. The majority of their business is in movie rental with a much smaller portion in sales.,"Start with a simple: (Profit = Revenue - Costs) structure Analyze the competitive situation Analyze the -substitution factor- how else are consumers getting movies? Costs: Cost of the new movies: (Actually decreased) Overhead: (No change) SG&A: (No change) Leases, other: (No change) Key Learning: Revenues: # of rentals: (decreased, traffic down) Price of rental: (No change) Sale of rentals: (decreased) Accessories: (No change) Costs have actually decreased, but not enough to offset the decreased store traffic. Competitive Assessment/Substitutes: (List potential causes of decreased traffic) New movie stores: (No real change) New In-home sources - cable on demand: (Potential for future but no real current affect) Sales of movies for home use and collection: (Sales have increased dramatically) [Once the key issues have been identified, the interviewer describes the changing industry:] 1. When division was growing, it could buy excess numbers of the new releases to satisfy customer demand. Later, they would send the excess copies to the new stores as part of their ""Ibrary"" of existing tapes. With fewer new stores opening, this is no longer an option-therefore fewer new releases have been ordered. 2. Recently, the studios have allowed new releases to be sold through warehouse stores (Wal-Mart) at the same time they are made available to the rental retailers. Thus, many of our customers are purchasing rather than renting. In addition, when customers rented a new release, they quite often rented an existing tape from the library (additional lost revenue). Based on this industry outlook, what would you recommend for the division? Provide a recap: It appears as though the major issue facing the division is a reduction in store traffic for new releases. This is mainly due to the sale of these same releases through alternate channels. How can we regain store traffic or offset the rental losses? Recommendations (these are just a few of the options considered): Develop new, more convenient locations-kiosks, pick-up/delivery Develop pricing/bundling formats combining new releases with existing movies Offer-rent to buy program s - rent the first time, then have option to purchase"

The following represents the allocation of each dollar spent to bring a bottle of Coca-Cola to the consumer. 5% Research and Development 25% Syrup/Bottling 25% Distribution 24% Marketing 10% Overhead 10% Profit Draw a chart with the dollar percentage allocations for RC Cola.,"RC Cola: 3% Research and Development 35% Syrup/Bottling 35% Distribution 15% Marketing 7% Overhead 5% Profit Rationale: To make it easier, start with the larger percentages. RC doesn't have the econon ies of scale Coke enjoys, therefore their n anufacturing is a higher percentage of costs. They do not have as efficient a distribution system (fewer products/ same # of locations), therefore it requires a higher percentage. Both of these leave less money available for R&D (look at the lack of new products), marketing and profit. Overhead is actually lower because they require fewer front-office people to run the business."
How long does it take for a baseball to travel from the shortstop to first base in professional baseball?,"Assumptions: The bases are 90 feet apart. The distance from shortstop to first base is about 120 feet. A major league pitcher can throw about 90-95 mph. A major league shortstop can throw about 80 mph. The key is to be able to convert miles per hour to feet per second 80mph to feet/hour: 5280 feet/mile: (80 x 5280) = 422,400 feet/hour Feet/hour to feet/second: 60 minutes per hour, 60 seconds per minute = 3600 seconds/hour (422.400/3600) = 117 feet/second 120 feet from short stop to first base, thrown at 117 feet per second = (120/117) = just over a second (1.02 seconds). Key: Don t be afraid to round off these large nun bers: 5000 feet/mile x 80=400,000 4000 seconds/minute: 400,000/4000 = 100 ft/second 120/100=just over a second It's nuch easier.

"A successful chain of Canadian auto service stores (Autoland) has entered several markets in the United States in hopes of duplicating their success in America. The stores offer two services: 1. Retail sales of auto parts for customers who prefer to perform their own maintenance. 2. A service center for fixing any automobile problem. from an oil change to a new transmission. Since entering the U.S., Autoland has experienced $50MM in revenue with losses of $20MM. The owner is considering pulling out of the United States. You have been hired to determine if they can improve their performance or if they should exit the market.","Analyze the market potential/customer segments Competitive Situation: What is the competitive situation in Canada? A: We are the major player (few local stores) Are we providing the same services in Canada as in the US? A: Yes Do we have strong competition in the U.S.? A: Yes, a national chain of stores in the exact format as Autoland exists in the U.S. They basically copied our Canadian format and have about 10 locations in every major city. They are very profitable in all cities including our U.S. markets. Assumptions: Due to size. I would guess they have superior buying power over Autoland in the U.S. Is this true? A: No, we have the same cost structure due to our presence in Canada. Assumption: The market has potential due to the con petitor's perfom ance. Key is to determine why they are out- performing Autoland. Autoland Capabilities: Assumption: We actually have to businesses under one roof, is one more profitable than the other? A: In Canada - no. But in the U.S. we are profitable in retail sales and losing heavily on the service center. Are the costs associated with each side of the business different? A: Yes, the service center is much more expensive to operate, we have to pay mechanics and have high fixed costs. Assumption: We are profitable in retail, but losing in service. We attract the wrong consumer. Market/Customers: Autoland provides two services, are the customers for each service different? A: Yes. The customers that shop for retail parts typically have lower to middle incomes and are trying to save a few dollars by performing their own maintenance. The customers who utilize the service center have higher incomes and no interest in fixing their own car. Assumption: We are attempting to attract two distinct customer segments. Are we doing this successfully? A: We are not sure, how would you help us determine if we are? Factors: Marketing: We do the same as competition. Pricing. Identical to competition. Location. Different, we are located in the inner cities to save money on leases. Where is the competition located? A: Between the inner city and the suburbs (on the border) Assumptions / Recommendations: Our location is great for the retail sales business, but prohibits heavy use of the service center due to the distribution of income between the inner city vs. suburbs. In new markets, locate between the lower and upper income areas to attract both segments. In existing markets, move, or drop the service business and retain the profitable retail portion."
"OFFICE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

Question:
An office supply company has asked you to determine why they are not as profitable as their primary competitor
(i.e. OfficeMax vs. Office Depot).","Approach:
Think of an Income Statement. Begin with Revenues and work your way down item by item (revenues, volume,
price, costs, fixed, variable, etc.). Identify any area that is not consistent with industry standards (as a % of sales).
Once you have identified a problem area, then you can begin to determine the specific cause and then make
recommendations for corrective action.

Solution:
In this particular case you would have discovered costs to be high. Further analysis would have identified variable
costs and specifically the cost of the products they are purchasing from their supplies. With even further analysis,
you would identify that shipping from the supplier is included in the price of these products. Furthermore, these
shipping costs are extremely high, because the suppliers are billing you for the shipping and thus have no incentive
for them to manage them.
Sample Conversation:
Interviewee – I would begin by analyzing the company’s Income Statement to identify an area to further
investigate. Therefore, are the company’s revenues in line with the industry standards?
Interviewer – Yes.
Interviewee – How about their costs?
Interviewer – They seem to be a bit high.
Interviewee – Knowing that the company’s costs are high, I would then analyze in detail their cost structure by first
determining if it is fixed or variable costs that need attention.
Interviewer – In this case, their fixed costs seem to be fairly consistent; however, their variable costs seem to be
high.
Interviewee – I would then analyze their individual variable costs beginning with the cost of their primary variable
cost, their products.
Interviewer – It does seem that they are paying slightly more than their competitors for the products they purchase.of he product? Taxes? Freight? And are these costs competitive?
Interviewer – The price includes both taxes and freight. The taxes are obviously the same for all buyers, but the
shipping costs do seem to be a bit high.
Interviewee – I would then note this as a problem area to be addressed in my recommendations and then look for
other problem areas.
Interviewer – It turns out that this is the only area in which we appear not to be competitive. What would you
recommend we do about it?
Interviewee – I would recommend that we separate the freight charges from the price of the products and pay the
freight ourselves (i.e. FOB). This would allow us to utilize the most competitive means of shipping the
products. Currently, the suppliers have no incentive to lower the shipping costs."
"LAUNDROMAT
Question:
You are the owner of a Laundromat in New York City. What are some ways you can increase profits?","Possible approach:
When this case was asked, the interviewee was told specifically that the interviewer simply wanted brainstorming: a
number of good ideas. The point is to demonstrate creativity and ability to think on one’s feet. However, it is
important to demonstrate structured thinking as well.
Break profits down into revenues and costs. Work through each separately.
Revenues:
• Use of machines
- Coins
- Other? (scan cards, etc. could promote loyalty and repeat business)

• Sell ancillary supplies, such as detergent, softener, bleach.
• Other goods and services.
Costs:
• Machines (upkeep and replacement)
• Marketing?
• Rent and utilities
Some possible ideas for increasing revenues include innovative marketing, such as having free live music or an
event, which attracts the media, and the sale of other good and services such as snacks.
Possible ideas for decreasing costs include allowing a charity to use some unused space in an attempt to convert the
business to non-profit status. Creativity pays off in answering this question."
"FOLDING CARTONS
Question:
A folding carton manufacturer has hired your consulting firm because it’s facing declining profitability in its North
American operations. What can you do to help?

Additional Data:
• Client is division of a bigger company. The division purchases its raw materials (paper) from another division
and pays a transfer price that is greater than the market price.
• Raw materials are the biggest percentage of carton cost. Labor is a relatively small percentage of
manufacturing cost.
• The client’s manufacturing process is almost completely automated. It spends a lot of time on equipment setups
now. The client isn’t sure how its capacity utilization compares with competition.
• Competitors haven’t made any recent significant changes in operations.","Approach:
• Start with the components of profitability.
Æ Consulting firm has two teams working for this client. One team is working on revenue sources, pricing, and
customer relationships. Our team is focusing on operations. At issue are the client’s 10 plants in North America,
and what the client can do to cut costs.
• Where are client’s costs coming from? Cost categories include:
• Fixed costs – overhead, plant space and related factory costs
• Variable costs – raw materials, labor
• What is biggest cost driver for the client?
• Plant capacity. Is client using plants as well as it could? Does it measure capacity usage now, and does it
benchmark against other similar companies?
• Factory operations. Is this a labor-intensive or automated business? What kind of batch sizes and setup time
are involved in the manufacturing process? How does this compare with what the competition is doing?
• Distribution and supply chain costs. What are these and how do they compare with the competition?
• Inventory levels. How much is company spending compared with competition?
• How might the business’s structure make our costs higher than competitors’?
• Are plants cost centers or profit centers? What are advantages and disadvantages?
• Why 10 plants? Is client saving on costs by having plants close to its customers or suppliers, or do the
costs of operating a plant outweigh these benefits?
• Is the competition doing anything differently than it has in the past?

Possible Approach:
Interviewer has steered you toward operations and cost concerns, so focus on those instead of on revenue and
product mix. (You may have time to come back to these at the end of the case.) As you ask questions and make
recommendations, think about what the client does internally and in relation to competitors.
Identify biggest drivers of cost and tackle those first. Raw materials (paper) are the biggest cost driver for the client.
The transfer pricing policy makes paper more expensive for our client than for the competition. Though transfer
pricing probably allows another division in the company to make money, the policy should be reexamined.
Discuss costs that happen all along the chain – from raw materials coming into the plant, to factory operations, to
distribution and sales costs. This division doesn’t really know how well it is using its plant capacity, so you can
recommend benchmarking against similar companies, so client can see whether its factory operations are more
expensive than the competition’s. Distribution and sales are not really an issue here, but you should raise the
question of why the company runs 10 plants (instead of 5 or 20). Is this an optimal number? What are the tradeoffs
of shutting plants or opening new ones?
Identify consequences of the way business is structured. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of operating each
plant as a profit center. Consequences may be that all plants try to sell high-margin products and steer away from
low-margin ones – which might not fit with the client’s marketing and product mix strategy as a whole. It’s better to
optimize all plants operations instead of run each as a profit center."
"SPECIALITY CHEMICALS PROFITABILITY
Background:
Client organization serves paper industry with specialty chemicals and seeks to increase profitability:

Currently just above breakeven
Serves 250 accounts with sales force of 150 “sales and service engineers” throughout Asia
Industry growth is moderate; 3-6% depending on paper industry utilization rates
Client company is weak #5 player; 6 players dominate market with some (limited fragmentation)
Top 6 players compete on service, product technology, and tailored “solutions”
How would you approach this problem?","Approach:
High switching barriers at account level, largely driven by “papermaking” chemistry
Account profitability varies wildly by size, type, and penetration
Product margins high and highly variable (i.e., 20-60)
Industry leaders enjoy 15-18% ROS
Very low fixed cost and capital required; barriers to entry are account-level share/relationships and product
technology
Solution:
Minimum - You should be able to determine that account-level profitability drives overall profitability
1. Construct simple P&L that reveals high cost of held force (i.e., 60+ of total costs)
2. Grasp the very local nature of business (i.e., single mill site)
3. Identify that accounts are the scarce resource to be optimized (i.e., profit per account)
Better approaches probe account-level economics and assess what separates a ‘good’ account from a ‘poor’ one.

1. Account size matters, provided the revenue is of ‘high quality’ (i.e., mix toward top of margin scale) and cost-
to-serve (i.e., number of on-site staff) is managed.

2. Account share is crucial – it takes at least one full-time person to serve most accounts, even if share is low;
semi-fixed nature of business is key driver of profitability
Outstanding approaches will grapple with issues of how to improve, rather than simply shred, unprofitable
accounts.
1. Identify that ownership of critical applications leads to trust and follow-on sales (high account share)
2. Recognize that individual skills and performance make a huge difference for relationships, service, solution
tailoring and local marketing/selling
3. Realize that a low cost-to-serve, low margin/revenue model could be created to improve profitability of small
accounts."
"STEAM BOILER HOSES
Background:
The consultant was asked by a diversified manufacturing client to help turn around the steam boiler hose division.
This boiler hose division provides boiler hoses for both external customers and the client’s boiler division.
Background information on the client and industry includes:

Boiler hoses are sold both with original equipment and as replacements.
There has been increasing price pressure in the industry.
The client is third of eight industry participants.
The following information is also available in response to questions asked by the candidate:
Last year P&L showed (as a percent of sales):
Raw material 70%
Labor 20%
Distributed overhead 10%
SG&A 15%
Profit (15%)

Raw material is a commodity petrochemical
At least two of the other companies in the industry are making moderate profits
Question:
How would you structure an analysis aimed at restoring profitability? Where do you expect to save costs?","Approach:
Could start with the following:
1. Drop the product line (apparently not possible because hoses are necessary for boiler sales).
2. Raw material prices (they are the same as everyone else’s).
3. Allocation of overhead (no savings and provides little potential).
4. Examine SG&A costs (standard industry fee paid for independent installers).
Solution:
Better answers will move beyond the previous answers to consider:
1. Scale economies (client is big enough to achieve scale production).
2. Production technology (client has modern plant).
3. Labor costs (wage rate and productivity are average for industry).
4. Raw material purchasing practices (materials are purchased through long term contracts based
minus a discount).
The best answers, following a logical progression, should stumble upon the actual answer: the product has been
over-designed, requiring excess raw material. The answer should consider the following organizational
implications:
1. How is our product engineering operation wired into the marketplace? (There is little contact between the
engineering and marketing/sales organizations.)
2. What kind of feedback are we receiving from our sales force? (Customers are delighted with our hoses, but
don’t require all the product features.)
3. Are there other areas in the company where similar problems exist?"

Question:
What has gone wrong?
Additional information (only if asked): Price is the main differentiator in this ""commodity"" market. Currently our
price is the same as our competitor's.","Answer: The main problem here is that demand for juice is going down, that puts pressure on the competitors to
drop prices to maintain their production level, as a result, not only do they have a decline in sales, but also a bigger
decline in profits.
On the inside, since individual producers want to take more profits, they produce more, and this leads to excess
supply, which in turn, creates waste. Since the producers are not able to sell everything that they produce, they
incurs losses, which make them ""sell"" at lower prices, which in turn creates even more pressure on their profits.
This is a vicious cycle that started with the decrease in overall demand, and continues further and further.
Things to consider in order solving the problem:
• Look for alternative places to sell the excess supply
• Limit the production per producer
• Decrease the number of producers"
"FLORIDA JUICE COMPANY
Question:
Your client is a cooperative of fruit growers in Florida who jointly own a fruit juice operation. Recently,
profitability has been down, sales revenue and profitability has decreased by 40%. As a consultant what are your
recommendations?","Possible Approach:
This is a 3 stage case, the first stage being the problem identification, second is the recommendation of solutions and
the third is investment decisions required to implement the solution.
Stage 1: Problem Identification
Possible frameworks to use are the profitability framework or the 3 Cs. Also you must need to understand the nature
of the business.

The company only produces orange juice, so the scope of the case is limited to orange juice. There have been
on changes internal to the company, costs have remained stable, but sales have declined. There is no change
in the overall market demand for orange juice, our selling prices have been stable relative to competitors. Our
competitors are doing very well, in-fact our main competitor has been taking our market share.
Our main competitor in the last 6 months has changed their orange juice formula from 10% juice and 90%
water to 20% pure juice and 80% water. Our formula still remains as 10% juice and 90% water. This is the
cause of our loss in sales.
Stage 2: Recommendation of Solutions (and calculations)
There are 2 possible strategies to advise the client: Switch of 20% (or more) pure juice formula and compete
as a premium product, or lower your selling price to compete on cost basis. To evaluate which strategy to
use, we need to know price elasticity of orange juice, the market segmentation of orange juice drinkers etc.. –
Assume that quality is a key order winning criteria, so you advise the client to switch to 20% pure juice
formula.
What are the implications on switching from 10% juice to 20% juice. Unit costs will increase. The price
breakdown of in the production of orange juice is: 5% orange fruit, 20% process overheads, 15% SG&A,
40% Distribution costs and 20% profits. What is the impact on our bottom line?
Assume selling price is the same, doubling the pure juice content increases the cost of the orange fruit to
10%, therefore profits margin drops from 20% to 15%. We lose 1⁄4 of our profits per unit. However, we get
to recoup our sales revenue back to original levels (up by 40%). Overall impact to profitability is
profitability increases by 30% (40 * 3⁄4).
Stage 3: Investment decision required to implement the solution
Question: Some additional plant equipment is required to implement the change from 10% juice to 20% juice,
we have 2 different options with 2 different cash flow returns (which one would you choose):
Investment Option Initial
CAPEX

Yr 1 Returns Yr 2 Returns Yr 3 Returns Yr 4 Returns
A 200 11 25 75 80
B 50 5 15 30 40
No need to ask for discount rate. Just be eyeballing the figures, the returns from Investment A do not sum to the
initial 200mil CAPEX. There is no way that Investment A can have a positive NPV. Choose investment B."
"UNIFORM RENTAL COMPANY
Part I - Question
Your client owns a business that rents uniforms to other businesses (hotels, restaurants, mechanics, etc). They
provide the uniforms to the client every morning, collect them at the end of the day, clean them and iron them and
deliver them again the next morning. This business currently spends 400 million dollars a year in suppliers to make
their uniforms, how would you recommend they cut these costs.

Part 2- Question
Evaluate and choose one of the following options:
1. Reduce the number of suppliers by 1/3 (the suppliers have agreed to give an 8% discount for every 100%
increase in the order size or its equivalent)
2. Establish a contract to buy a fixed number per year to only one supplier for a 16% discount.","Part 1 : Possible Approach
Reduce the number of suppliers to get higher discounts
Use closer suppliers to reduce transportation cost
Focus on the fewer industries (hospitals) to reduce the variety of supplies and get volume discounts
Use different materials (better quality fabric to last longer or cheaper fabric)
Refurbish uniforms
Vertical integration, (buy the supplier, start up a factory, join venture)

Part 2: Possible Approach
A 1/3 reduction of suppliers would translate into a 50% increase in the order size per supplier or a 4% discount, this
multiplied by 400 million would give us a reduction in costs of 16 million.
The second option would give a discount of 16% that would translate to a 20 million reduction in costs. Solely by
the numbers this option is better.
It is important to mention that the second option would mean that the company has to order the same number every
year, and if they need more they have to buy at market price and if they need less they still have to buy the same
amount which produces losses. If you go by option one, and reduce the number of suppliers by 2/3 instead, then you
would get the same 16% discount of the second option without the need to buy a fixed amount every year. So the
first option is better if you can reduce the suppliers by 2/3 (assuming you can get all that you need from only one
third of the suppliers)."
"FREQUENT FLYER

Question:
A large commercial airline is in the process of evaluating the merits of its frequent flyer program. How would you
determine the value of this program?","Approach:

The value of this program is essentially the benefits less the costs. While the benefits can be determined by
finding out a) how many customers switch to the client’s flights due to the frequent flyer incentive and b)
how much do these customers pay for a ticket when they do so.
The rest of the case centers on determining the cost. To do this, you must identify the cost drivers from both,
the demand side as well as the supply side.
The demand (or customer) side drivers include:
• Most traveled seasons
• Most traveled destinations
• Demographic characteristics of those that redeem miles
• The split between business and leisure redeemers
The supply (or airline) side drivers include:
• The number of frequent flyer miles given away (these constitute a kind of liability)
• The number of frequent flyer miles redeemed
• Incremental administrative, logistical, in-flight, advertising, and promotion costs of the program
A good way to express the cost of the program would be $ per frequent flyer passenger mile or $ per frequent
flyer mile redeemer
You may finally suggest ways to reduce or limit these costs, e.g. improve the operations for this program or
limit windows during which passengers can redeem miles."
"HEALTH REFORMS

Question:
You have just been appointed Chief of Health Reforms and have discovered that kidney dialysis is a major portion
of public health care expenditures. What analytical techniques do you use to determine if this cost can be reduced?","Approach:

Essentially, you want to see if costs are high due to incidence, cost of procedure, or both. You also want to
see if any unscrupulous practices are being used.
Analyze the proportion of public versus private health expenditures that are applied to kidney treatment to
determine if unscrupulous practitioners are pushing this expensive treatment onto the public health budget.
Compare the incidence of kidney disorder in this country with other countries. Is ours higher? If so, public
policy or efforts to increase awareness help reduce it?
If incidence is indeed higher for the US, build a model (regression perhaps) that will somehow determine the
factors that are most related to kidney treatment. Perhaps those who are typically covered by public funds
(the poor, the elderly) have a higher incidence of kidney problems. Is there room for any type of preventative
program for these groups?
If the cost of the procedure seems high in comparison with similar medical procedures, it could be due to
professional fees, consumables, or capital equipment costs. Limiting the amount of government
compensation could cut professional fees. Employing new technologies could cut consumables and
equipment costs."
"NEWSPAPER COMPANY

Question:
A newspaper publisher has been experiencing declining readership and as a result, declining profitability. What
should it do?","Approach:

It is important to recognize that advertisements are the major source of revenue for newspapers. But this
revenue is totally dependent on readership.
It turns out that all newspaper publishers share the same plight and TV is the main culprit. To fight this, the
client can, at best, study other markets where TV is prevalent but newspaper readership is high (like Japan)
and use any knowledge they gain to promote readership in the U.S. They could share costs via newspaper
publisher associations.
To compete with other newspapers and periodicals, the client can determine customer preferences and tailor
contents to them. But any differentiation created will quickly neutralized by the competition.
The best course of action is to build mechanisms to continually adapt to changing reader tastes. This could be
accomplished by market studies, flexible and versatile staff, etc.
Also, the client should focus on cost rationalization to increase profitability. This would mean consolidating

operations and reengineering them. Consolidation would help in deriving economies of scale whereas re-
entering would increase operational efficiencies."
"CANDY COMPANY

Question:
Your company is a rather successful producer of candy. It originally started as a single product company and has
diversified its product line over the last few years. The production process consists of two basic activities:
manufacturing and packaging. The firm has also expanded its sales through product line extensions. Management
is concerned that sales are growing, but profits are not increasing at the same rate. What can your company do?","Approach:
This is revenue vs. cost exercise. Margins are shrinking.
Find out about the critical components of cost: raw material, labor and fixed cost. Raw materials are commodities
with cyclical prices, which have fallen in recent years but are expected to swing up again (this, as you have guessed,
makes the problem worse.) Labor and fixed capital has increased per unit over-proportionally compared with ten
years ago. Find out that the company’s controlling system is still focusing on the manufacturing part of the
production and the cost explosion occurs in packaging (candy is candy, the product line extension is primarily an
issue of different packaging.) Controlling schedules manufacturing which is rather efficient already, but not
packaging, thus causing slack in labor and fixed capital (small batch sizes, high setup times.)
Solution:
Possible solutions: reduce product line, introduce controlling/scheduling measures for packaging. Qualifier: are the
company’s customers (i.e. retailers) willing to accept the reduced product line?
Find out about revenue killers: concentration of retailers, trade brands, retailers demand large introductory discounts
for new products, high failure rate of new products.
Other good solutions: streamline product line, reduce low margin trade brand production, emphasize pull
marketing, and reduce introduction rate for new products."
"COSMETIC COMPANY IN EUROPE

Question:
Eurocos, Inc. produces and sells various cosmetics products in several European countries. The company’s different
brands are well established in the markets. The various products are quite similar in terms of raw materials and
production.
The company has been doing very well in the past, however profits have been shrinking in recent years. The CEO is
thinking of changing his strategy in the industry. He asks you if this is a good idea and what he should do?
Additional Information:

Market - many small to medium size companies, with many small to medium size brands.
Few big companies owning several brands.
Eurocos produces all products in all countries.
Transportation costs are small (see operational part).","Possible approach:
What is the structure of the industry? Fragmented industry.
Why?
low entry barriers (small setup costs, . . .)
high product differentiation (many ways of differentiation)
divers markets, customer needs (language, complexions)
barriers: tariffs, customs
How can fragmentation be overcome? Feasible for Eurocos?
Create EOS and learning curves Yes
Standardize market needs No
Separate the product’s commodity aspect from fragmenting aspectYes
Changing environment: reduce tariffs Possible (explore)
Possible solution:
Consolidate production while keeping the marketing and branding nationally decentralized.
Pros:
EOS in production (better sourcing, longer runs, quality) optimize location (interest rates, wages, labor)
Learning curve of running a more complex plant and logistics (see also Cons)
Keep “fragmented” marketing required in the market
Total inventory decreases (safety stock at original plant locations can be pooled centrally)

Cons:
More complex central operation
Increased logistic complexity
Transportation costs increase
(Operational aspect: optimal plant location with respect to transporting goods to warehouses. Possible assumptions:
Plant location at (x, y), national WHs at (xi, yi), demand per country, cost linear with distance, shortest travel
distance.)
Solution:
Should the company seek dominance now?
Have the driving forces for fragmentation disappeared? No, the fragmenting factors from the market are still in
place. The company has not changed is strategy in the fragmented industry (dominance makes no sense), but has
gained an advantage by operational changes."
"SKI RESORT

Question:
Net Income of $500,000 needs to be increased to $1,000,000. Assess our options.","Approach:
Current Slope Mix
Skiers mostly (no snowboard park, etc.)
60% - day skiers (single day)/ 40% - resort skiers (multiple days, 3-5)
Impacts on Revenue
Volume: # of skiers (have to back into)
Product Mix/Price: Day skiing only ($35/ticket)
Impacts on Costs
Fixed Costs: $1,000,000/yr
Variable Costs: $10/skier
Others
Outsource concessions (income negligible)
Small slope with little advertising
Many surrounding slopes that are far better known
Solution:
1. Determine the type of slope
• Who are the “typical” visitors

What are the sources of revenue
What are the sources of costs
2. Determine how many visitors per year currently
3. Determine how many visitor per year needed to reach one million in profit Æ is it feasible
4. Suggest ways for reaching goal
Give a suggestion (i.e., night skiing, increased advertising, snowboard park, new lift, raising prices, etc.)
Æ think about what affects mix, volume, or price
Does it fit with current customer?
What costs would be associated with the idea
Approximately what revenue would be gained by the idea (Is there any cannibalization or trade-offs)
Is it a good idea?
Repeat the process
5. Summarize with explicit recommendations
Note: Think of the hourglass. Address the issue. Get to the premise of the problem quickly. Is the problem fixable?
If so, brainstorm ways to improve the issue. But be aware of trade-offs, increased costs, etc."
"SCHOOL CAFETERIA

Question:
When the school cafeteria workers went on strike a few years ago, the school union experienced a significant
increase in sales. However, when the financials for the quarter were reported, the union discovered the profits
actually decreased. What happened?

Additional Information:
The interviewer then asks me how - assuming no pre-generated data - I would have gone about discovering
that they were losing money on sandwiches. On a practical basis, you’d have to look at the cost in aggregate.
Perhaps how much they spend in a week on sandwich ingredients, the hours spent making sandwiches, and the
number of sandwiches sold and scrapped. Then you’d calculate a cost per sandwich and compare it to the
selling price. Ideally, you’d also want some overhead allocation, but this is a good start.","Possible Approach:

Did they lower prices? No
Did their costs go up – paying staff overtime or extra to obtain raw materials at the last minute? No
Did overhead costs increase significantly? No
Did they introduce new items? No
So prices did not change and costs did not change... did the overall mix of what they were selling change? Yes,
the union sold more sandwiches and drinks than before.
Upon further investigation, we discover that they were actually losing money on each sandwich they sold
(selling them below cost)."
"GOING UP
Question:
An elevator maker is experiencing profitability erosion. How would you begin to analyze the company’s situation?","Possible Approach:
Initial Approach

Sales trend? Declining over recent years
Market share / positions? Still second largest domestic player
Cost structures? Product costing to date indicates that large portion of costs are fixed
Narrowing
Given that a large part of costs are fixed, economies of scale may be a factor.
Demand revenue side - costs are truly fixed, and increased sales with low marginal costs will drive
profitability.
Cost supply-side - company’s process is fundamentally uncompetitive and benchmarking / re-engineering
work will be of more impact.
Note: It is often better to establish two paths and let the interviewer choose; however, if the interviewer is not
obviously more excited about your pursuit of one or the other, pick the one you feel is more robust, justify your
choice, and pursue it. Return to the other path if there is time or for unanswered questions at the end.
Demand side
What drives demand? New construction obviously.
Who are the customers? Contractors.
Have the underlying economic trends changed? No, commercial construction remains flat in the company’s
geographic areas.
Micro level
What are the decision factors for customers? [through customer interviews] Turns out that along with
price/performance, reputation and availability of service are key factors.
How is the product priced? How much does this influence the purchase decision [price quotes, surveys]?
Product is competitively priced, and actually represents relatively small share of average project cost for
contractor.
How is the product perceived in the market? [market research] Service reputation is low in many markets
relative to competitors.
Attack this point and present possible recommendations to address this problem."
"YELLOW PAGES
Question:
The client is a printing company (books, magazines, etc.) It wants to make more money from an existing customer
for whom they print yellow pages phone books. The client is in the 2nd year of a 10-year contract. How do we
increase the profitability of the customer?

Additional Information:
Other answers were also acceptable. For example, increasing the amount of advertising in the book could increase
the volume of pages printed. Ideas include bundled ads for smaller retailers, discounts on purchases of multiple ads
in multiple books, etc.","Possible Approach:
To increase profitability we can look at decreasing costs and increasing revenue.
Costs
After exploring a number of possible ways to reduce cost, it was clear that only a minor adjustment was possible on
the cost side.
Revenue
Revenue is based on the number of pages printed. The client can’t legally increase the price because of the contract.
Therefore an increase in the volume of pages printed is needed.
Conclusion
To increase the volume of pages printed, the client can encourage the phone company to sell more phone books by
including smaller geographical areas in each phone book."
"HOSPITAL PAYMENT SYSTEM

Question:
A non-profit hospital wants help to reduce the $10 million loss that the organization has been experiencing in the
last 3 years. If the hospital continues this level of loss for more than 2 years, then the hospital endowment would be
completely gone and the hospital would need to close its doors.
Problem: It is realized that the hospital’s loss was due to a new law which basically fixed hospital prices because of
the new DRG (diagnosis related groups) hospital payment system in New York State (i.e. price per unit could not be
changed.) What profitability improvement levers should the team focus on first if the team wants to quickly reduce
the hospital’s loss? What would you expect to find?","Possible Approach:
A good approach to this issue might be to discuss the different costs associated with performing the hospital’s
services and the current capacity vs. demand for the hospital. The correct conclusion is that it is quicker and easier
to change the cost structure and capacity of an organization than to change the demand for the hospital’s service
(remember the price per unit is fixed so the revenue lever remaining is increasing the units of service.) Reducing the
capacity and shifting some costs from fixed to variable would help restore the hospital’s profit.
Conclusion:
A more complete answer would discuss some of the revenue levers even though they may take longer to work. The
team could explore some of the marketing issues such as:

What draws physicians and patients to a hospital and where do the patients come from? (It turns out that most
patients come from local communities surrounding the hospital and that focusing efforts on the local
neighborhoods that are under represented by the hospital can increase patient volume.)
How does the client hospital compare to the competitors along service dimensions that are important to
patients and admitting physicians? (The hospital was outstanding at patient care but lacked convenience.)
What are the trends in patient care and how should the hospital change to exploit the opportunities? (Recent trends
are towards outpatient services and away from admitting patients for long periods of time. For example, cataract
surgery used to be an in-patient procedure requiring a hospital stay of three days or more. In the last few years, most
of the cataract procedures performed require no hospital stay, there seems to an opportunity providing a very
convenient outpatient facility to the community)."
"BICYCLES LTD

Question:
Your client designs, manufactures and markets a full line of bicycles. The company had been growing in sales and
profits when its profitability flattened, and then began declining 3 years ago.

Additional Information:
The key to this case is to methodically dissect the cost structure for the company, and knowing what the components
of cost are (i.e. cost accounting).","Approach:
1st analysis - Assess whether revenues, expenses, or both are the source of decreasing profits.
• Revenues growing at roughly the same rate as before the down-turn
• Expenses increasing disproportionately
• (Would use financial statements to assess this data)
2nd level analysis - Analyze source of increasing expenses:
• Operating/Administrative? Administrative costs growing, but operating costs appear to account for
bulk of increased expenses.
• Components of Operating Cost – Fixed/Variable: Fixed costs growing but variable costs appear to
account for the bulk of increased expenses.
• Components of variable cost – direct/indirect: Both have been growing. Bicycles have become more
sophisticated, with better materials and components (However, the increasing cost/bike has been
comparable to the growing price/revenue per bike). Indirect costs are increasing disproportionately.
• Components of Indirect Variable Cost - Materials, Labor: allocations of indirect material about the
same (Loss of bikes about the same). However, allocation of indirect labor appears to be the big
problem.
• Why is indirect labor increasing? Examine WIP: increasing. Look at the factory floor, many bikes
waiting around. What are the bottlenecks? Not capacity related - plenty of throughput available.
Much time appears to be spent nowadays in set-up - resetting paint booths, welding jigs, dies and
presses, etc.
• Why has set-up time increased - either by increasing the number of set-ups of bikes or increasing the
set-up time.
Increased set-up time? No. It has actually decreased as the workforce has improved set-up
tools/jigs etc. Workforce turnover, labor relations, etc. are all fine.
Increased set-ups? Yes.

Conclusion:
At the time of the profit decline, the industry had been trending towards increased specialization in bicycles:
touring/mountain/racing/hybrid/etc. This company had responded with rapidly proliferating product lines, leading
to increased number of set-ups and lower volumes per assembly run.
Solution: Rationalize product lines, and try to increase shared components across model lines."
"PLUGS

Question:
We were doing work for a consumer electronics firm (e.g. Federated, Silo Circuit City) who had experienced losses
for the previous several years and was in a difficult financial position. How would you have approached this case?

Additional Information:
Providing with income statements for the average store for the client and some competitors (expressed as a
percentage of sales).","Possible Approach:
Economies of Scale
The client had a number of stores that were simply not large enough to reap the economies of scale necessary
for this business.
This was not reflected in the cost information provided as this was in a format which gave averages per store.
The economics of scale were important because of numerous large fixed costs, including advertising and rent.
They needed to rationalize their retail outlets.
NB the company as a whole, did achieve economies of scale in purchasing; their product margins were
similar to competitors.
Competitive Scale
The company wanted to be a high service company, but their payroll averages were below that of competing
firms (some of which were competing on the same basis).
Advertising expenses were well below industry average - not a good idea in this line of business (often
impulse buys at seasonal sales)."
"HUNT & FISHING MAGAZINE

Question:
Our client is a media conglomerate that owns a hunting and fishing magazine. Profitability has fallen. What can they
do to improve profitability?","Possible Approach:

Explore both the cost and revenue portions of the profitability equation.
Find out what has changed to cause profitability to fall and then see what might be done to improve
profitability.
Costs
• These have not risen dramatically.
• There is no opportunity to reduce costs further.
Revenues
What components make up revenue?
• Circulation (subscriber) revenue - circulation has increased and the goal is just to break even with
subscription revenue.
• Advertising revenue - this has fallen dramatically.
• With the increase in number of subscribers, there has been a change in the composition of the
subscriber base.
• The audience is now more general, but the advertisers were targeting the hunting and fishing market
specifically. They have stopped advertising as they no longer reach the same audience.

Solution:
Cut back circulation and focus on a specialized group.
Understand what’s important to the advertisers."
"SMALL BANK

Question:
Our client: A small national bank.
Its competitors: Regional banks and big national banks
Problem: Profits are smaller than those of their competitors. Why? What can the company do?","Possible Approach:
Why do their competitors earn higher profits?

Big Banks:
• Enjoy economies of scale (same centralized services, more offices to allocate their costs to).
• Size allows them to profitably use processes and technologies that smaller banks cannot implement.
• Large amounts of available capital allow them to accept/attract bigger clients.
Regional Banks:
• Size and geographic concentration: lower overheads (less hierarchy, less paper shuffling, smaller
distances to be traveled).
• Brand name: customers may feel represented by ‘their’ local bank, preferring it to the rest.
• Better knowledge of the client base: ability to choose the best clients.
Conclusion:
What can the company do?
Grow: mergers/acquisitions.
Rationalize: sell some offices and acquire new ones in a profitable region (probably a bad idea).
Specialize: offer some services that the big banks don’t want to offer and that the regional banks cannot
afford to offer (if there are any services like these)."
"Question:
Our client is a European pay telephone manufacturer. They are experiencing sharp decreases in profitability after a
history of strong, consistent earnings. Their competitors are facing similar problems. What should they do?","Possible Approach:
Develop questions using an approach driven by Five Forces and the 3 C’s. This elicits the following information:

The buyers of the equipment are either large private telephone companies or state-owned agencies.
Not all equipment is interchangeable, depending upon switching devices, etc. however, most companies can
produce variant systems to comply with large market requirements (accepting different coins, ability to
connect to different switching equipment, etc).
The adoption cycle for underdeveloped countries is odd. The typical network economics operate - if you’re
the only one with a phone, who do you call? After the first movers buy, the installed base increases until the
initial saturation level is achieved. At the same time, private phone purchases increase, somewhat offsetting
the need for further purchases of pay phones. Once phones become ubiquitous, the final saturation point is
achieved. From this point forward, a replacement cycle begins in periods of about five years.
At the time of the case, credit card public phones were vastly increasing in demand. Most markets had
experienced aggressive programs to replace the old coin phones with this new product.
Conclusion:
The recent wave of large credit card phone installations meant that the old phones were being replaced before
physical obsolescence. The entire industry will experience a downturn until the newly installed base in the large
markets needs replacement. They have no choice but to wait for this next wave of replacement purchases."
"Industry Analysis Cases
VIDEO GAMES
Question:
The CEO of a large, diversified entertainment corporation has asked you to examine the operations of a subsidiary
of his corporation that manufactures video games. Specifically, he needs to know if he should approve a $200
million capital request for tripling the division’s capacity. What are the critical issues you should plan to examine to
determine if the industry is an attractive one for the CEO to continue to invest and why?","Approach:
Market share

Division is third largest manufacturer of hardware in the industry with 10 percent market share.
Top two producers have 40 and 35 percent market share. Remainder is divided by small producers.
Division sells to broad range of consumers.
Sales
Division sales have increased rapidly over last year from a relatively small base. Current estimate is annual
sales of 500,000 units.
Current estimate of industry hardware sales is 5,000,000 units annually. Industry growth has been strong
though over last few months, sales growth has slowed.
Division’s current sales price for the basic unit is $45 per unit.
Division remains less than 20 percent of parent company sales.
Top 2 competitors also develop, manf and sell software/games though division sells only licensed software.
Industry growth of software continues to increase.
Costs
Division estimates current cost is $30 fully loaded. Requested expansion should reduce the cost by 5 to 7
percent and triple production of the hardware units.
Top two competitors are estimated to have a 10 to 15 percent cost advantage currently.
Main costs are assembly components and labor.
Customers
Division estimates much of initial target market (young families) has now purchased the video game
hardware.
No large new user segments have been identified.
Distribution
Primarily outlets of distribution are toy and electronics stores.
Profitability
Division currently exceeds corporate return requirements, however, margins have recently been falling.
Product
Hardware standards have been established by the industry leaders.
Product features are constantly developed (e.g., new type of joystick) to appeal to segments of the market.
Note to the Interviewer
The primary issue of the case is to determine if the industry is attractive and, especially, if our client’s position in
that industry is sustainable. The candidate should identify issues which are necessary for assessing both the industry
and our client’s position, but should not be expected to solve the problem.

If the candidate begins to discuss too deeply a specific issue, before having covered the key issues overall, bring
them back to discuss the industry more broadly by asking “what other issues must be examined?”
If the candidate is discussing issues which seem irrelevant to the attractiveness of the industry, ask, “how will that
analysis help to assess the attractiveness of the industry or our client’s position?” Then, ask the candidate to identify
other issues which must be examined.

Solution:
Acceptable approaches would determine:
1. What is future market potential? Ask about overall industry growth, the saturation of markets, competitive
products (home computers), and declining “per capita” usage.
2. What is the competitive outlook? Should at least recognize the need to examine competitive dynamics, such
as concentration of market shares; control of retail channels; and R&D capabilities (rate of new product
introductions, etc.).
3. What will be the price/volume relationships in the future? Issues of prices need to be considered.
Better answers would address:
Market Potential

Recognize that there is a relationship between market penetration and growth in new users which, when
combined, yields an industry volume estimate.
Address the shifting mix of product purchases, in this case from hardware (player unit) to software (video
cassettes).
Seek to look at buyer behavior in key segments, i.e., “fad” potential of product.
Software
Recognize technology standards are set by industry leaders. In this situation, the division as a secondary
player will have to follow these standards.
Recognize that different distribution needs may exist for different products (in this case hardware versus
software).
Price/Volume Relationships
Discuss the effect capacity additions can have on overall industry price/volume relationships and on industry
price levels.
Company Ability to Compete
Should ask what the capacity expansion is designed to do.
Explore the cost position of the client division relative to that of other competitors.
Seek to understand reasons for poor profit performance of division."
"FURNITURE MANUFACTURER

Question:
You are having lunch with the CEO of a major furniture manufacturer (couches, loveseats, and tables). He shows
you this income statement for their furniture company and gives you some industry averages. He is trying to figure
out what is going on and any recommendations that would you have?
Income Statement
Gross Revenue 600 105% of Net Revenue
Net Revenue 570
COGS 496 87% of Net Revenue
Gross Profit 74
SGA 57 10% of Net Revenue
Operating Profit 17
Interest 0
Taxes 6
Net Profit 11 2% of Net Revenue

Industry Average
Returns & Allowances = 2%

COGS = 80%

Net Profit = 10% of Net Sales

Starting Points:

What are our client’s goals? Client is primarily interested in maximizing profit.
Why do furniture manufacturers have returns and allowances? If the retail furniture seller sees visible marks or
tears on the furniture.
Does our client have more expensive raw materials? No, they have similar RM costs to the industry.
Does our client have more expensive labor costs? No, they have similar labor costs to the industry.
Does the client’s competitors have economies of scale advantage? No, we actually have the largest sales in the
industry.
Does our client have more expensive transportation costs? No, they have similar transportation costs.
What is the market? Describe the customer segment(s) that they sell to? Our market and so is our competitors
is the medium priced furniture, as such this does not include the extremely expensive furniture so both groups
are selling the similar type furniture.

Who does our client typically sell furniture to (segment) ?
Æ End customer – Apartment dwellers and first-time home buyers
Æ Immediate customer – 40% to furniture stores and 60% through department stores where client has exclusive
arrangements to sell only their furniture – One dept. store accounts for 10% of all sales.
Who does our client competitors typically sell furniture to (segment) ?
Æ End customer – Apartment dwellers and first-time home buyers
Æ Immediate customer – 90% to furniture stores and 10% through department stores where client has exclusive
arrangements to sell only their furniture.
Are there price differences in what we charge the two different customer segments?
Æ Yes, our salespeople tell us that the department stores typically demand a price break for the exclusive
arrangement or else they switch to a competitor. They have also been pushing for larger price breaks in
recent years.
How do we sell to these different segments? We hire independent furniture salespeople to contract with each
store.
How do we compensate the furniture salespeople? We pay them a 5% commission based of Net Revenue.
Do the salespeople have the ability to adjust the price? Yes they do.","Possible Approach:
Consider the problem from both a cost and revenue perspectives. The Five Forces framework, if used properly,
allows you to realize that the main problem is not a cost issue, but a revenue issue due to the major buyer market,
department stores, that this furniture manufacture is using. They are using their buyer power to demand price
discounts or else they will switch to a competitor. That is why the rest of the industry does not rely on department
stores for much of their revenue. As such, this company is getting more revenue at the expense of poor profitability.
Identifying that this is a revenue issue is a B answer.
Solution:
The A answer also includes insight into the poor incentive plan for the independent furniture salespeople since it is
based on net revenue and not on gross margin. One suggestion may be to internalize the salespeople positions for
the department stores, especially since your largest customer, 10% of sales 60MM, the sales rep earns $3MM per
year for that account.
The A+ answer also recognizes that the 2% Net Profit includes no interest so that this company has no debt and is
under-performing which means two things. First, with loan interest, this company could be losing money, and
second, being all equity-based and under-performing may make this an attractive takeover target."
"MERGER CANDIDATE IN THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY

Question:
A major chemical producer has asked us to evaluate another major participant in the industry. Both companies are
bulk commodity chemical producers. We have been asked to begin our work by analyzing the future prospects of
the target company’s main product line, a bulk chemical used in the production of plastics. Essential facts include:

Production of this chemical has slowly declined over the last five years.
Prices have declined rapidly.
There are 7 to 8 major producers; the largest producer has a 30 percent share; number two has 20 percent our
target company has 15 percent; the rest is divided among other competitors.
The two largest competitors earn a small return; target company is probably at break-even; rest are operating
at break-even or loss.
The largest competitor has just announced construction plans for a major new plant.
How would you structure an analysis of the target company’s future prospects in this product line?","Approach:
An acceptable approach should, at a minimum, address the following issues:
1. What markets use this chemical, and what has been the nature of growth in these markets? (End-use markets
are largely automotive-related.)
2. How much overall capacity exists now? (Far too much.)
1. What has been relative capacity utilization of competitors in the industry? (60 to 70 percent for last 3 years.)
2. What are relative cost positions of competitors? (Related to size/efficiency/age of plant; target company has
reasonably “good” position.)
Better answers will move beyond the previous answers to consider:
1. How rational is pricing? (Prone to self-destructive cuts to gain temporary share points.)
2. Are there niche or value-added uses for chemical? (Not really.)
3. Does the chemical have a major by-product or is it a by-product? (Not of significance.)
4. How often have companies entered/exited, and how expensive is entry/exit? (Entry expensive; exit cheap for
most because older plants are fully depreciated.)
5. How important is this product line to each of the competitors? (Most producers are diversified.)
The best answers could address:
1. Reasons for announced capacity expansion. (It is a bluff to try and get smaller competitors to shut own.)
2. Is regulation important? (Yes: all competitors have installed pollution control equipment.)
3. What is nature of operational improvements that target company could make? (Lots.)
4. How is product sold and distributed? (Economies of scale in marketing and transport are critical.)
5. Is there synergy between our client and target? (Not really.)"
"AIRPLANE MANUFACTURER
Question:
You are consulting to a CEO of an airplane manufacturer. In the last couple of years you have gone from being
number one in market share to number two. In addition, another company has announced that it will be entering the
business and is presently tooling up its plant. As a consultant, what are the concerns your client might face, what
additional information might you want to find out, and what recommendations would you have?","Approach:
The airplane industry’s demand is a function of travel amongst two classes: business and leisure. Business travel
increases as a result of globalization. Leisure travel increases with growth of middle and upper classes. Business
travelers are primarily insensitive to price, leisure travelers are very price-sensitive.
The current competitor; a comparison:
Price, service, technology, heritage, safety. It turns out that the competitor’s plane is cheaper to operate because it is
more fuel-efficient. The consultant should ask strategically whether the firm is interested in the manufacture of more
fuel-efficient planes. The answer would depend on the future of oil prices. Instead, it may be better to try to
compete on the basis of price, safety and service.
Prevention of a new competitor gaining market share:
Solution:
Key: creation of barriers to entry.
Long-term contracts are pre-emptive.
High concern, on the part of purchases, for a proven safety track record."
"AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER

Question:
Your client is a large agricultural equipment manufacturer. Their primary product line, farming tractors, is losing
money. What questions would you ask of your client to help them solve their profitability problem?","Approach:
You might want to start off by asking how many competitors there are. Suppose there are two direct competitors.

Your clients 40% of the market, competitor #1: 30%, competitor #2: 15% with the remaining 15% belonging to
many small manufacturers.
Five years ago, your client had 60% of the market, competitor #1: 15% and competitor #2: 10%. Obviously,
your client has lost significant market share to its two competitors over the last few years.
Do all three competitors sell to the same customers?
Your client’s product is priced higher than the others. Has this always been the case? (Yes)
Are the products the same?
- Essentially yes, they all have the same basic features. Of course, tractors are not commodity items and a
few differences do exist.
What are the differences that allow you to charge a premium for your product?
- Your client has a strong reputation/image of quality in the market and the market has always been willing
to pay a premium for that reputation because it meant they would last longer and need less maintenance.
This can be critical for some farmers who can’t afford to have equipment break down at a critical time.
Are sales revenues down? Are sales quantities down? (Yes)
Is the price down? All costs the same? (No. In fact both the price and costs are up.)
Have fixed costs increased? (No. Material costs (variable costs) have gone up out of sight, and the client has no
answer as to why material prices have gone up so much.)
Do you manufacture your tractor or just assemble it? (Primarily an assembly operation.) Finished part prices
have gone up? (Yes)
Raw material prices for your suppliers? (I don’t believe so)
Have labor costs increased for your supplier? (No)
Have you changed suppliers? (No)
Why are your suppliers charging you higher prices for the same product? (Well, they’re not, the prices have
increased as a result of our product improvement efforts. We’ve tightened tolerances and improved the
durability of our component parts.)
Why do you make these improvements? (Because we strive to continue to sell the best tractors in the world.)
Are your customers willing to pay for these products improvements? (What do you mean.)
Are your customers willing to pay a marginal price which will cover your cost of implementing these
improvements? (I don’t know. I guess we assume that they will. . .)

Solution:
It turns out that the prices have been raised to cover the costs of these improvements, but the customers do not value
these improvements unless they are essentially free, so sales are down. The client needs to incorporate a cost/benefit
analysis procedure into its product improvement process. Don’t forget though, that you must consider the long-term
effects of these decisions."
"TAIWAN

Question:
You are a consultant advising the government of Taiwan. Government officials want to move from low value-added
products, like textiles, to high value-added products, like aerospace.

Additional Information:
What not to do –
Forget about profitability and competitors.
Ask about Taiwan’s history and culture without addressing the issues in the case.","Possible Approach:

What are Taiwan’s resources?
• Labor? Skilled workforce.
• Capital? Inflows from Europe and America?
• Infrastructure?
• Components? Supplier industries?
What does the industry look like on a global basis?
• Is it profitable? Is it growing?
• Who are the players / competitors? What are their competencies?
• Can we find a niche?
Who would the buyers be?
• Can we serve them?
Also, what will the country lose by moving away from low value-added products, like textiles?
• Dislocation of workers"
"BOOK PUBLISHER

Question:
Develop a strategy to help a major book publisher explore new strategic opportunities and risks.","Possible Approach
Key factors

Buyer power has been increasing due to the movement away from the corner bookstore towards the large
chains that give discounts to readers off the publisher’s price.
Internet book sales give more power to the buyer.
Increasing substitutes caused by video games, books on tape and video on demand.
Increasing competition between publishers causing reduced margins (buyer power) and saturated market
(increasing substitutes) and proliferation of titles. Also no real branding among publishers that published the
last book that you read?)
Increasing competition leading to higher advances to well known authors (millions of dollars in many cases).
Conclusion:
Become a market leader by announcing new terms and conditions for the large book retailers. If the other
major players in the industry follow the lead, the industry may become more profitable as a whole. If not, the
client may need to move back to the old terms in the industry.
Focus on the books or types of books that have an expected positive NPV. The proliferation of books
probably has caused unprofitable titles.
Forward integrate into bookstores.
Develop online strategy that capitalizes on existing distribution relationships and pricing strengths."
"INTRA-OCULAR LENSES

Question:
The client produces intra-ocular lenses. It is known for premium quality and used to be the market leader, but the
overall market and the client’s share have declined. What should be the strategy to become the market leader again?","Possible Approach:
What has changed since the time of market leadership?:
Company

Product, prices, sales/marketing changes? Nothing significant.
Customer
Have customer wants / needs changed?
Have buying / usage behavior changed?
Are there new buyers?
Customers have become more price sensitive and the type of buyer has changed. The new buyers are
institutional buyers rather than doctors.
Competitors
New entrants, new products, different positioning, new substitutes? The product has become more
standardized, more of a commodity product.
Solution:
A new distribution system to target institutional buyers rather than doctors and a low cost product are key to
selling to new buyers in this commodity market.
Cost leadership is important because of the commodity nature of the product.
Note: You can change the frameworks to be more useful to you and to be less obvious to the interviewer. Here the 3
C’s framework was used, but many of the Porter concepts were also adopted in the questioning."
"SPARK PLUGS

Question:
We have a client who is interested in opening a manufacturing plant for spark plugs in Spain. How would you
advise them?","Approach:
The interviewer begins by pushing for your snapshot of the size of the Spanish spark plug market. Think through all
the uses for spark plugs in an economy (cars, trucks, diesel engines, lawn- mowers, etc). How many sparkplugs per
cylinder in an engine? What is the market segmentation of the car market (4-cylinder vs. 8-cylinder cars for
instance)? How many cars per year are manufactured in Spain (new market each year)? Ignore corporate fleet
demand and truck market - only look at consumer market. What is the economic life of spark plugs?
One possible figure.
Assume:
Mention other uses of spark plugs but focus on passenger car market for simplicity.
Population of 36 million.
Assume number of new cars bought each yr. per family
Assume economic life of new cars
Number of spark plug changes over economic life, etc.
After achieving an annual demand number for spark plugs, analyze the market conditions. Use Five Forces.
Suppliers/ Buyers strength, barriers to entry, threat of substitutes, firm rivalry conditions. Probe interviewer for raw
materials needed for spark plugs. Is Spain well situated because of market isolation? Low wages? Proximity to
supporting industries, manufacturing consumers, etc. What are the different cost components to spark plugs (raw
materials, labor content, transportation, margin, etc)? What are technology needs in the manufacturing process?
Understand order-winning criteria for auto manufacturing contracts. The firm wants to capture how the candidate
will attack, frame and dissect a very complicated process in both a country and with a product that they are
unfamiliar.
Note: This case incorporates a tour de force of Porter’s Five Forces analysis, a country Diamond overview, your
ability to conduct ""guesstimations ""in foreign markets and a basic understanding of supply chain interaction."
"PETROL STATIONS

Question:
A large oil company with nation-wide retail petrol stations wishes to evaluate the competitiveness of its outlets.
What would you want to look at, how would you look, what would you hope to find out?","Approach:
What drives customer preferences? (subjectively and empirically)
If the client has enough stations, consider the different stations in similar customer situations (traffic flows,
population, competition) and understand how differences in format, pricing and services affect volumes. -
This is a convenient point at which to apply the 4 Ps framework.
Where good peer groups are not available, it is possible to, pilot changes in certain aspects of the store’s
situation to understand what effect these changes have. This may then generate follow up questions about
how to design and ensure the reliability of such tests.
Market research to understand subjective customer preferences. A survey combined with demographic
profiles. (This is a good point to cover things you think might be important about gas stations such as price,
convenience store, service, paying at the pump, easy entrance and exit, well lit, design aspects, ease of credit
card payment, etc.) It would also be appropriate to compare with industry averages.
Brand loyalty - if the good locations in a market are foreclosed to me, does it matter how competitive my
stores are? Will customers switch stations - what switching costs are involved and what type of benefits do I
have to impart to win volume?
Consider both content issues (such as using the 4 P’s framework) and the process issues (i.e. how to get the
required information - as covered in the points above)."
"Question:
Our client: A big Canadian Retail chain
Problem: Wal-Mart has just brought a retail chain in Canada. Should we be worried? Why? What can we do?","Approach:

Data: We own 20 stores, Wal-Mart just bought 50. We sell more or less the same as them, and their stores
are close to ours. Therefore, they can be a threat to our operations.
Are they a threat? Check the financial data:

Us Wal-Mart
Revenue 100% 100%
COGS 50% 53%
Store Operations 20% 22%
Corp. Overheads 20% 20%
Operating Profit 10% 5%

This data doesn’t tell us much: our higher profits could come from higher prices, which we wouldn’t be able
to maintain once we had to compete face-to-face with Wal-Mart. Therefore, the next thing to do is to
compare their prices to ours. How? Easiest way (what they actually did): go through a Wal-Mart store, and
take notes. Compare a set of their products with ours.
Once they did this, they found that Wal-Mart was 10% cheaper. What does this means?
It means that if we are forced to match their prices, we will have an operating profit of around 0%.
Solution:
What can the company do?
Lower costs. Problem Wal-Mart is exceptionally good in this area, and we will probably be unable to match
their costs.
Sell them our chain, give in. Not a viable solution, so move on...
Try to differentiate us: appeal to the Canadian’s sensor of patriotism (buy Canadian). Will probably not
work in the long run, because eventually people will get tired of this and just buy where it is cheaper.
Use our better knowledge of the Canadian customer to optimize our product line, targeting Canadian tastes
and preferences.
Change our product line: Sell some products that Wal-Mart does not offer, products that can be sold at high
margins."
"CAR MANUFACTURER
Question:
Your client is dominant auto manufacturer in the US, you are hired to implement a cost reduction program. Where
would you start, what are your recommendations?","Possible Approach:
This is a 3-stage case, the first stage being the problem identification, second is the recommendation of solutions and
the implementation of the solution.
Stage 1: Problem Identification
Focus on the main cost components in the car manufacturer.

Fixed Costs: Overheads, Plants, Capital Equipment and Variable Costs: Labor, Direct Material Costs.
Benchmark your client’s costs relative to that of a competitor. It turns out that the Direct Material Costs (i.e.
car components and sub-assemblies) are much higher than that of our competitors.
Why? Each car model requires too many variants of components. For instance one model of family sedan has
24 variants of steering wheels. The result is that our steer wheel supplier is not able to have economies of
scale in its production of steer wheels and passes the increased costs to us. Our client has over 30 chassis
platforms for all the models in its range, while our key competitor only has 12 different platforms.
Stage 2: Recommend Solution
The solution is to lower component costs by lowering the number types of components and have different models
share the same base components or platforms. E.g. Instead of having 24 kinds of steering wheels, attempts to reduce
the number of variants.
What is our basis for reducing the number of variants? Similarity in design, parameters and requirements.
Overlapping parts. After using this criteria, we now have reduced the number of steering wheel variants from
24 to 10, how do we go about further reducing this?
Each steering wheel can be separated into several components, the ring, the frame, the covering and the
electronics. We can arrange the components in terms of value, of which the ring and the frame are the most
expensive parts. We can further save costs by treating the ring and the frame as the base product, and the
covering and the electronics as customizations onto the base product. The supplier simply provides one
variant of the frame and ring, and we independently customize each steering wheel by adding different
coverings and electronics.
This allows to vendor to have economies of scale by having only to produce one type of frame and ring.
Stage 3: Implementing the Solution
Explore how you would convince the various stakeholders about the merits of this new method of component
sourcing. For example: the manufacturing engineers, the designers, the sales & marketing dept, the finance
department. What is the impact to each of these groups?"
"Market Expansion Cases
CO-BRANDED CREDIT CARDS

Question:
An oil company has its own credit card that many of its customers use when they fill up their car with gas.
Recently, other companies have begun entering into agreements for co-branded cards (i.e. Amoco + Visa). This
company wants to know if it should do the same. Either way, should it continue to offer its own credit card?

Additional Information:
• Considered the marketing research that had been conducted.
• Explored the focus of the company (they had no business trying to run credit card processing).","Possible Approach:
CUSTOMER
• Do current customers value the card - do they use it? About 20% use it and like it.
• Would a co-branded card draw new customers or increase loyalty? Yes, people indicated they’d be more
likely to visit our stations if we had the co-branded cards. However convenience is the main consideration
when selecting a location.
COMPANY

• Is the company currently performing the processing in-house - is it profitable? Yes, they’re doing it in-
house but are not making much money on it.

• Would the co-branded card processing be out-sourced - does it offer attractive margins? That’s an option;
the margins appear to be better if processing is out-sourced.
COMPETITORS
• How many competitors have co-branded cards? Only two, but others are looking.
• If they don’t move now, would their choice of partners be limited? Probably.
RECOMMENDATION
• Offer the co-branded card, but out-source it. Given that existing customers use and like the company card,
they should continue offering it, but attempt to shift customers to use the co-branded card.

• The data processing operations for it should also be out-sourced. They should research marketing (co-
marketing) tactics that could improve the attractiveness of the card to the company’s customers - with the

intent of increasing the number of customers."
"TIRE MANUFACTURER.COM

Question:
You are having lunch with a former client, the CEO of a major automotive tire producer. She explains that they
have been toying with the concept of the company making a foray into e-commerce. She hasn’t devoted much
thought to the strategy involved and would like you’re input regarding the attractiveness of such a move.
Additional Information:
• Client is currently largest player in the industry but facing traditional domestic competition in addition to
increased foreign competition
• Client’s competitive advantages have traditionally been brand, customer relationships and technological
innovation.
• Client’s main business is supply to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
• Secondary existing channel includes franchised service and retail outlets
• Third channel is direct sales to industrial clients (fleet services)","Approach:
Key Issues:
• What are the capabilities of e-commerce?
• Direct sales
• Service complement via customer service, product information, etc.
• Sourcing data/order management system
• Channel data/order management system
• Other intranet capabilities
Æ Client is primarily interested in direct sales opportunities (other uses of electronic data interfaces are in use or
under development)
• What is the market?
• Segment description and size
• Who would buy tires over the internet (installation?)
• Break the market down
• Draw a pie chart! How big of a slice can you get?
• What are the advantages to the consumer for buying tires online?
• Does that overlap with segments served by existing channels?
• What are competitors doing? How will they respond? How quickly?
• What are the alternatives to e-commerce? (Phone orders, direct mail, etc.)
• What are the advantages of this channel? Disadvantages?
• Cost reductions? Margin comparison to other channels?
• Underserved segments?
• What investment is required? What is the relative ROE compared to other channels?
• What will be the impact of an e-commerce strategy on existing channels? What will that do to channel
relationships?
• How is the product delivered? Installed?
• Is there an advantage to forming a strategic alliance with an e-commerce merchant prior to developing our own
capability?
Notes:
Consider the problem from both marketing and operational perspectives. Framework starts from “where’s the
market going?” and goes to operating tactics to enable necessary innovation, “how do we get to there?”
Identify what segments might want to buy online (“bargain hunters”, “web surfers”, etc.). Why do they want to buy
online? (Price, convenience) How big are these segments? (pie chart to get percent of total market then size total
market). Which segments are most profitable to serve? Why? Which are growing the fastest? Why?
How do you deliver the “order winning criteria” (OWC) that the segments demand? (do not use the term OWC,
they’ve heard it 20 times so far that day). One concept is to use the existing service and retail outlet channel in
combination with just in time (JIT). Customers would purchase tires and schedule an appointment for installation
online. Installation would occur at a local service and retail outlet of the client’s. If convenience is the OWC then
perhaps the vehicle is picked up at the consumer’s home or business and returned later that day.
The online order might initiate the delivery of the merchandise to the outlet via company shipping or expedited
shipping (UPS?) and be connected to the company’s inventory and manufacturing management systems
(manufacturing resource planning -- MRP, enterprise resource planning -- ERP). This saves money for the company
while allowing channels to maintain a margin. It also reduces costs for the service and retail outlets through lower
inventory levels and smaller stores while increasing customer satisfaction through guaranteed stocking and
improved service (appointments).
Same concept could be used with alternative channels (Sam’s Club, Kmart) in areas without service and retail
outlets to allow expansion without incurring the administrative costs related to outlets (which may no longer be the
most efficient/profitable means of selling tires to consumers).
Does the company have the capabilities required to enable this strategy? If not, how do they develop or acquire
them? How will competitors react? Is the company better off regardless of what competitors do? How does the
company sustain an advantage in the electronic marketplace? Does it make sense? Should the company do this
itself or seek a partner?"
"MEDICAL PRODUCTS MANUFACTURER

Questions:
The client is a producer of medical products selling primarily to hospitals and doctors. The client wants to
expand/enter the home health-care market. The initial investment will be $70 million. How would you evaluate
whether or not the expansion/investment is a good idea? What are the key issues and key success factors you would
evaluate? What information would you need to make the decision?","Approach:
New Market Analysis:
A 5 forces type framework would be useful in analyzing the new market.
Need to gather as much information as possible about the new market.
Questions you’d want to consider:
What is the size of the home health care market?
What does the competition currently look like?
Who are the players?
What is their relative market share?
How long have they been in the market?
What do they compete on?
Is the market growing?
Are there any barriers to entry that I would need to consider?
Operational/Current Capacity Analysis:
Does the client have excess capacity?
Will there be any additional equipment needed?
Are the manufacturing processes similar? Is the new market a complementary market?
Will we need a new supply chain?
Financial Analysis:
Quick NPV analysis – discuss how you would determine if the expansion will add value to the company (i.e. will
the annual cash flows discounted back at the WACC provide a positive NPV?)
Strategic Analysis:
Does the expansion fit with the companies’ vision?
Does it fit with the company’s image?
Is the new market complementary to their current lines of business? Is it a logical fit?
Is their current market mature (i.e. do they need to diversify in order to maintain sales/earnings growth?)?"
"FEEDING THE ARMY
A foodservices company wishes to explore new markets in order to help meet its goal of increasing revenue by
15% over the next few years. A market that they are interested in is feeding the hungry men and women in
the US military. Is this a worthwhile opportunity?
Interviewer Information:
Company has $1BB in revenues for the past few years with minimal growth.
Company average net profit margin is 5% on revenues.
Company is engaged in foodservice and facilities management, with 80% of revenues attributable to foodservices.
The company does not currently have any contracts with the military or the federal government.
The company is Canadian.
The company is primarily looking to serve food in military dining halls for military personnel who live on base.
A mess hall can be viewed as similar to a college dining hall.","Possible Approach

Interviewee should first define “worthwhile.” In the context of the problem statement, an expected interpretation
should be whether or not entering this market will make a significant contribution to realizing the 15% revenue
growth over the next few years. Additionally, the interviewee should be expected to perform a simple industry
analysis to determine barriers to entry, etc.
To answer the first question, a rough market sizing should be done. It is not so important that the numbers come out
to be anything particular; however, the interviewee should be able to brainstorm and identify the likely key drivers
of revenue for this market:
Size the market
The purpose of sizing the market is to determine if the opportunity is large enough to significantly increase
revenues.
Market Size (annual revenue) = [number of people in the military] x [average meals per day] x [average price per
meal] x [days per year]
Some reasonable numbers might be:
Market size = [500,000 people in the military] x [3 meals per day] x [$3 per meal] x [365 days] = $1.5 BB >>
$$150MM
Interviewee should conclude that the potential market size warrants further investigation into the opportunity.
Industry Analysis
The purpose of this is to determine how this market works, how profitable the industry is and what the key success
factors are to enter the market and gain market share in the industry.
The interviewee should try to gain clarity around exactly what services the company can perform and how they will
make money. This might be done in the context of a 5 forces type analysis.
Power of suppliers: Food suppliers are specially certified by the government as Prime Vendors. The company will
have no freedom to choose suppliers. The company will not need to buy the food from the suppliers; food will be delivered each day by the supplier and paid for by the government.
Potential implications to recognize: Company will not be able to leverage existing relationships with its own,
possibly higher quality suppliers. Company will not be reimbursed for the cost of food, therefore can be expected to
be reimbursed for labor involved in value-added activities such as cooking, serving and cleaning. It should be
recognized that the last implication will reduce the potential revenues if the interviewee assumed that the price per
meal included the cost of food.
Power of buyers: The end users are military personnel. The buyer of the foodservice is the military dining facility.
The mechanism of purchase involves competitive bid processes to win a 10 year contract, at which point it is re-bid.
The winning bid is the typically the low cost bid. Government regulations define who is qualified to bid. All of the
current contracts that have been awarded to private businesses have been award to small or disadvantaged
businesses due to government regulation. Our company is not small or disadvantaged. Government contracts
reimburse cost plus a “reasonable” margin for profit.
Potential implications to recognize: The company is unable to compete due to regulations and is required to partner
with or subcontract to small businesses. This will have effects on the potential revenues (a minority interest in a
small business, or a subcontracting situation will reduce the revenues). The market will have to be captured in
chunks as each 10-year contract comes up for bid – thus for every $100 in market revenue, only $100/10 will be
available for bid each year.
Industry competitors: Military dining halls are served by military personnel or local small disadvantaged
businesses. There is only a small tendency for dining halls to shift from using military personnel to private business,
thus the market is reduced to that currently served by the small businesses. Currently small businesses serve about
20% of the military bases.
Potential implications to recognize: This immediately reduced total market size by 20%.
Threat of new entrants: Government contract regulations are the primary barrier to entry. It is not clear that the
government will change its rules with respect to awarding contracts to small businesses.
.
A final market sizing may adjust for the above factors:
• $1.5BB = base market size
• Adjustment for not being able to charge for food = 1⁄2 (assumes food drives half the cost of a meal)
• Adjustment for contract staggering = 1/10 (can only bid on the 10% of contracts that come up for re-bid
every year)
• Adjustment for the bid process = 50% (assumes company wins 50% of the contracts it bids for)
• Adjustment for military-served dining halls = 20% are served by small businesses
• Adjustment for partnering with small business = 50% company approximately splits the revenue with the
small business.
$1.5BB x [1/2] x [1/10] x [50%] x [20%] x [50%] = $4MM possible in first year...worthwhile?
The interviewee should have a plan for how to enter this market, and be able to articulate the implications of the
plan and the state of the industry on the likely revenues to be captured from this market. A recommendation on
whether or not to proceed should be provided."
"ACQUIRING NEW AIRLINE ROUTE

Question:
A major American airline is considering establishing new routes from Tokyo to several sites in the United States.
Would you recommend that they take this action?","Approach:
• We are dealing with establishing new routes and not acquiring existing ones.
• This case requires a complete examination of the customers and competition.
• Customers consist of both business and leisure travelers. While business travel from Japan to the U.S. has
been declining at about 25% over the last year, leisure travel has increased at a faster rate. It is expected
that leisure travelers will continue to grow at a faster rate than business travelers. Currently, about 50% of
all Japanese travelers to the U.S. are leisure travelers.
• It is extremely expensive to buy gates at Tokyo’s crowded airport.
• As it turns out, competition will come not only from other airlines at Tokyo, but also from a new airport
that’s being built in Osaka.
• Furthermore, Osaka is expected to attract a very high percentage of the leisure travelers. It is very
inconvenient for leisure travelers to fly out of Tokyo, where there’s heavy congestion and where prices tend
to be higher due to high gate prices. It is estimated that the leisure travelers at Tokyo airport could decrease
by 25-30%.
• If our client continues with their plans for buying gates in Tokyo, they will find it difficult to attract the
growing percentage of leisure travelers needed for their new routes to the U.S. It probably makes much
more economic sense to buy gates in Osaka instead.
• Another insight is the recognition that Osaka will increase the total number of airport gates in Japan. The
intense demand for gates at Tokyo will decrease considerably with the greater supply of gates at Osaka.
This fact most likely doesn’t change the benefits of buying gates in Osaka. However, there may also be a
new opportunity for our client to buy gates cheaply in Tokyo to establish new business traveler routes to
the U.S."
"BABY BELL DIVERSIFYING

Question:
A Baby Bell company is interested in diversifying into other areas besides telecommunications. They are
considering entering the market for electronic home security systems. Would you recommend that they do so?
Additional Information:
• The company is a holding company. They have previously made unsuccessful forays into software and
into real estate.
• The home security industry is highly fragmented. The top five players in the industry generate less than
4% of the total industry revenues. This implies that the industry largely consists of small, regional
companies.
• 10% of all residences currently own an electronic security system.","Approach:
• This is in some sense a razor and razor blade sort of business. The economics are:
Item Retail price Cost/Margin
Equipment & Installation $500-$1500 0-10% margin
Monthly service $20/month $5/inonth
• What strengths/competencies of the Baby Bell company are useful in this market?
Installation expertise
Operator services
Transmission system (phone lines)
• It turns out that the “expensive home” segment of this market is saturated. Growth has been slow in recent
years.
• Price sensitivity is unknown in “moderate-priced home” segment.
Conclusion:
The conclusion is that this business is a reasonably good fit for the company, and that more market research needs to
be done to assess the growth and profit potential of each segment of the market."
"PAYROLL PROCESSING

Question:
A company is very successful in the payroll processing business, allowing employers to out-source their payroll
function. The client is considering an expansion into the processing of pension checks for financial institutions.
Does this product extension make sense for a low-cost producer, and how can they best penetrate this market?","Possible Approach:
• The crucial question is how the checks are currently being processed (in-house by fund managers and banks
or out-sourced to other providers) and why?

• It turns out that virtually all financial institutions which disburse checks on a regular basis process them in-
house and are relatively cost inefficient in doing so. This however, does not necessarily present a market

opportunity on the basis of cost reduction. The check processing fees are an attractive profit center for all but
the smallest financial institutions because they can pass the costs (plus a huge margin) on to their clients.
Since the check processing fees are a relatively small part of the total fund management expense, the margins
can be very large without customer complaints. This makes the sub-business of in-house check processing
very attractive to many of the potential customers of the outsourcing business.
• Another factor which makes this product extension unattractive is the importance of accuracy and timelines in
check disbursement. The financial institutions would lose a great deal of goodwill if their “out-sourced
check” processor screwed up, and they had to explain to thousands of upset pensioners that it was another
company’s fault. Spending a little more to have it done in-house was considered prudent by many fund
management institutions.
• Note - the check processing business is not always cost driven (i.e., low cost might be critical to small
employers but quality may be more important to fiduciary service providers) and that a cost center for some
potential clients (businesses) might be a profit center for others (financial institutions)."
"LONG LIFE BULBS

Question:
A light bulb manufacturer currently sells light bulbs for $1 that last one year and cost $.50 to produce. There are
three other competitors, and each of the four (4) producers has 25% market share. They develop a new light bulb
what lasts 10 years and costs $1 to produce. You can produce either the old or the new bulb. Which one do you
decide to sell?","Possible Approach:
Company must have low variable costs and high fixed costs, so you want volume.
While the bulb could be sold at a price where consumers are indifferent between two types, a lower price
could lead to increased market share.
Just because it lasts for 10 years, it will not run the industry. The higher price should compensate producers
for reduced overall volumes.
A potential problem with increased production is that if your competitors develop the new bulb and regain
their market share, you will be left with excess capacity.
Produce the new light bulb.
Notes: Price and volume is the key here. You can price it ten times the current bulbs. But, the important issue here
is, whether or not the customer is willing to pay ten times for an unproven product. Then the next question to ask
will be can we provide them a guarantee? Note that it becomes a durable product now, it is not a commodity. Some
can still identify it as commodity but it is more like TV, PCs or Cars, more of a home appliance now. So you should
think of pricing and marketing it like a home appliance.
You should also consider, how long will it take your competitors to enter the market, how fast can you convert the
customers to new habit. Is it possible to acquire customers in such fashion that the revenues / conversion of
customers are relatively flat over 10 years, rather than acquiring a huge customer base right now and then there is no
replacement market in year 7-10."
"UTILITIES

Question:
With the deregulation of the electric utilities industry, there is increasing competition in the U.S. A client competing
in this industry in the U.S. (American company) is considering expanding overseas. They have been slowly
investing throughout the world and have the opportunity to potentially enter into a joint venture with a Malaysian
electric utility company. They deal will encompass two U.S. power plants and 2 Malaysian power plants and the
two companies will split the profits 50/50.
Should the client enter the joint venture?","Approach:
Clarify the alternatives:
Why would the client do this?
What do they get out of it?
Think about doing a COUNTRY ANALYSIS – is the country a stable place to do business? What is the
economic outlook? Are there growth opportunities? What does the electric utilities industry look like in
Malaysia? Competition, size, growth, etc.?
Are there barriers to entry for a foreign firm? If so...the JV would be an easy way for the American
company to enter the market without all of the difficulties/restrictions that they would face if they attempted
to enter on their own.
Broad strategic analysis
Try to think of the benefits for the U.S. Firm:
Lower barriers to entry if they go with the JV
Diversifying their interests – beneficial since the U.S. market is highly competitive
Adopting a presence in the foreign market
Diversifying their risks – don’t put all eggs in one basket
What is the downside?
Country risks – economic & political stability
Currency risks
Financial Analysis
NPV analysis – will the cash flows provide value?"
"50-YEAR LIGHT BULB

Question:
You are an inventor. You have invented a light bulb that lasts 50 years. You want to market it and, in order to secure
the finance, you need to prepare a 10-year plan for the bank.","Possible Approach:
Start out by:
Gauging, market size, comparative costs (cost of light bulb x no. of times you have to replace it), and
distribution channels.
Assess at what level you can sell it for - and thus estimate revenues.
Use of 3 Cs - Customers (who are they), Competition (what do they have), Capacity (what is it and could you
be undercut or undercut them?).
Explore opportunities for light bulbs of differing lengths less than 50 years as you may end-up cannibalizing
your own market.
Conclusion:
If your light bulb lasts for 50 years you pose a real threat to the current manufacturers. Assess their level of
profitability and, assuming they are not likely to quickly discover this technology, offer to sell them the
patent for the light bulb as you could otherwise destroy their market (replacements would only then be
needed every 50 years - good business for a few years only, for 10 years - unlikely you’ll have a market for
that length of time!). If they refuse to buy it, or offer too low a price then start production and earn your
money that way.
NOTE to establish a business plan, you need to cover:
• initial capital investment required
• fixed and variable cost elements of running costs
• capacity and expected level of utilization
• level of working capital required for day to day operation
• expected sales - initially, and the expected growth over the 10 years
• Given the issue of cannibalization you should address the question of whether the machinery can be used for
other purposes, once sales reduce."
"NYC BANKING DEMAND

Question:
How would you determine whether a location in NYC holds enough banking demand to warrant opening a branch?","Approach:
The demographics of the area surrounding the prospective branch should be examined. Population, business
concentration, income levels, etc. should be compared with those of historically successful branches.
Competitor reactions could easily make this venture unprofitable, so it is essential to anticipate them.
These will depend on the importance of the area to competitors (in terms of profits, share, etc.).
The client will have to match competitors’ incentives to customers – we should estimate the cost of these.
The client must examine if the new branch would complement their existing competence and strategy (retail
or commercial; high growth or profitability, etc.) and what purpose it would serve. If the need focuses on
deposits and withdrawals only, maybe a cash machine would suffice!"
"WIRELESS SERVICE IN MEXICO
Question:
Your client is a large diversified manufacturing company with global operations and is considering whether they
should participate in the closed envelope auction process for a license to give wireless service in Mexico.
Your client wants to know the issues to consider when deciding whether to bid or not and how much should they
bid?","Possible Approach:
The first things to ask here is how many subscribers could you service with this license, which regions are included,
and for how much time. It is also important to consider how many licenses are being auctioned now and in the
future. How many bidders are going to participate would be helpful to know too.
The other things to consider in this problem could be divided into 4 big sections:
1. Market attractiveness
a. Size of market (can they afford this product, substitute products)
b. Number of established competitors and their power (locations they serve)
c. New entrants (consider price wars, and differentiation)
2. Company operation
a. Synergies with established divisions operating in Mexico
b. Suppliers
c. Distribution
3. Risk/Reward
a. NPV
b. Political and economic risk
c. Exchange rates, inflation and other financial risks
d. Other projects (cost of opportunity)
4. Bidding process
a. Competitive analysis of other bidders (game theory)
b. Access to information compared to other bidders (to make a better bid)

To practice numbers: estimate the size of the wireless market in Mexico."
"NEW CAN

Question:
Drink cans were traditionally made from three separate pieces of metal (top, bottom, and side). A new technology
known as the two-piece tin is now in use at many canning facilities in the U.S. Imagine that you are in the executive
conference room of a large U.S. canning facility that is considering transferring to the two-piece technology. Take
on the role of each of the vice-presidents of the facility and present to me what you think each of them would have
to say about the decision to stay with the three piece or move to the two piece.","Possible Approach:
An impressive way to start this answer would be to ask if the factory was organized by function or process. Since
factories are typically functionally organized. I would start by saying something like:
“Why don’t we go along the value-chain and explore the benefits and advantages for a manager responsible for each
segment of the chain?
This is not an exhaustive list, but it serves to give you some ideas.
PROCUREMENT
• Lower metal content reduces raw materials inventory, freeing up space and cash.
• Identify new suppliers for high tech materials or work with existing to change material specs.
HUMAN RESOURCES
• Downsizing from increased automation.
• Retraining lead-times.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
• Probably plug and play with legacy systems.
INFRASTRUCTURE (Finance, accounting, quality. . .)
• Where is the money coming from?
• We should be able to sell the three piece line to a subsidiary or company operating in a developing country.
OPERATIONS
• Change-over options (pilot or parallel run unnecessary unless we are an early adopter, more likely a shut
down start-up implementation utilizing around the clock vendor technicians and our engineers.
• Large positives with new machinery: lower maintenance, better control interfaces, high volumes and
tolerances, less staff but more highly trained.
DISTRIBUTION
• Infrastructure compatibility (pallet sizes, stacking height, handling- ease. . .)
SALES AND MARKETING
• Customer reaction - are we an early adopter - if not - no issues, if yes, some education required e.g. cost
and environment - less waste, ring pull stays with the can, so less litter.
SERVICE
• Non-issue? Explore.
One problem with this case and many in general is that it parallels a HBS case - Crown Cork & Seal. If the
interview knows that it is taught in your core strategy class he / she may expect:
1. A much richer answer.
2. You to reveal that you are familiar with the case - I wouldn’t tell them before starting since this will raise
expectations.
However, it may be that the interviewer can tell that you have done the case before, because you answer too quickly
and in too much detail for it to be spontaneous. If this is the case, it is better to be open about your familiarity with
the case."
"REPLACING ALUMINIUM

Question:
The client is in aluminum production. The market for aluminum is declining slightly. The client has a new
technology to use plastic in place of aluminum in some products. The completion is six (6) months behind in
developing plastics. Should the client pursue plastics or stay with aluminum?","Approach:
ENVIRONMENT

Explore the reason for the decline in aluminum market: is plastic replacing aluminum?
What about cannibalization of existing products?
COMPETITION
Expected actions of competitors - not a co-operative oligopoly - high rivalry in declining aluminum industry
will lead to price wars and declining profits.
PLASTICS MARKET
Profitability in relation to aluminum.
Customer needs / desires satisfied by plastic - does plastic offer significant benefits? Is it inevitable that the
aluminum producer will shift towards plastics?
New competitors in the plastic market?
Costs of entry - minimum efficient scale for plastic is 10% of the volume of the aluminum market.
Fit with current production (use excess capacity or must build new plants?) and distribution
Are there other substitutes for aluminum and plastic?
KEY ISSUES
Potential cannibalization.
High rivalry in a declining industry (aluminum) will lead to price wars and declining profits."
"ISRAELI TRAVEL AGENCY

Question:
An Israeli travel agent has been extremely successful. His primary source of revenue is customers who fly to and
from the US. He manages to fill up over two plane loads on a daily basis. Given his success, he is considering
buying an aircraft and flying the US-Tel Aviv route himself. What advice would you give him?
Additional Information:

The client is attracting customers due to his own promotion and reputation. He will probably continue to do
so if he were to buy his own aircraft. Also, access to hubs, etc. would not be a problem.
If the route is extremely busy, it is probably very lucrative for other airlines too. The dominant operator on
this route is El Al (a large airline with deep pockets) that finds this route extremely attractive.
If our client were to enter the industry, he would doubtlessly trigger a price war initiated by El Al since, if he
were to do so, other small operators would want to follow our client’s lead and soon El Al would pretty much
lose this important source of profits.","Approach:
The only way our client could fight this price war is by differentiating itself from El Al and other airlines and
charging a price higher than El Al’s. But any such move towards differentiation will be matched by El Al,
and our client will be forced to go out of business. It is therefore best to maintain status quo."
"GROCERY STORE BANKING

Question:
One of our clients, a supermarket chain, is considering opening an in-store bank. No other competitors in their area
are currently doing this. How should we help them think about this?
Additional Information:

Floor space required is equivalent to a florist department, etc. There are currently no other better uses for this
floor space.
There are three options for the project:
- Start own bank.
- Joint venture with an existing bank.
- Lease the space to an existing bank.","Approach:
There is little opportunity cost in launching this project.
Revenues will come both from bank transactions and effect on consumer habits.
Bank revenues depend on nature of agreement.
If JV or own bank it will be driven by types of transaction (savings, checking, other low margin transactions)
and number of transactions per day. Estimates can be gotten from:
- JV partner
- Industry information
If leasing, flat fee (can explore what it’s worth to a bank).
Consumer habits may be changed by increased traffic and increased sales per person.
Traffic may increase due to bank “draw”- need to estimate.
Access to cash may allow for larger purchases (ATM and credit card sales do the same thing).
Discuss the risk/reward tradeoff of strategic choice of how to approach project."
"CONSULTING FIRM

Question:
You are the managing director in a large international consulting firm. Traditional strengths of your firm have been
solving strategy and organizational issues. Recently, you have noticed an increasing number of your firm’s
proposals are being rejected because of a lack of information technology expertise in your firm. So far, your firm’s
growth has been strong enough that proposals lost have not hurt annual earnings. Nonetheless, you are becoming
increasingly concerned about the need to develop the firm’s capabilities in information technology.
1: Assuming your concern is valid, what reasons will you provide to other partners about the need to acquire
information technology skills?
2: Assuming you are able to convince other partners of the importance of IT expertise, what steps would you
take to rapidly build IT capacity in this area?
3: What are the major risks in executing an IT capacity-expansion?","Approach:
1: Good answers focus on the value of IT to clients: discussion topics include the increasing importance of
information in business, strategic value of information and information flows, importance of information
systems for implementing new organizational structures and management control systems.
Better answers focus on the costs of losing clients to competitors: discussions included the encroachment
costs of having clients talking with competitors about IT problems, risk of losing credibility with clients by
not being able to solve a problem.
2: Good answers will focus on various methods to build expertise: buying expertise by acquiring another firm,
by raiding IT practices of other firms for a few key consultants, building capacity through recruitment of IT
experts and training them to be consultants, building capacity by training current consultants in IT practice
skills, establishing a strategic alliance with a IT boutique firm.
Candidates should discuss the pros and cons of each method proposed: impact on firm’s current culture, cost
to the firm, time needed to build expertise, etc.
Better answers will realize the importance of stimulating client demand as capacity builds through seminars,
articles strategic studies in IT areas...
3: Good answers depend on the expansion methods discussed, but an important issue is the loss of the firm’s
focus away from just strategy and organization.
Better answers will focus on the difficulty of implementation in IT, rapid technology changes in the IT
industry require significant ongoing training and development costs; new practice cultures may be
significantly different from current culture, especially if “external experts” are brought into the organization."
"SELECTIVE BINDING

Question:
Your client is a major fashion magazine that has been offered by its printer a proprietary new process called
selective binding, which enables publishers to customize the pages included in magazines based on demographic
data known about the reader. For example, an ad in Better Homes & Gardens for lawn chemical services could be
placed only in those issues going to subscribers who live in houses and not to those living in condominiums or
apartments. In this way, advertisers can focus their communications on the demographic segment they are targeting.
Would you advise your client to take advantage of this new process and offer selective binding to its advertisers?","Approach:
This is a pretty straightforward cost/benefit analysis. The magazine would want to consider offering the service to
its advertisers if it would be able to enhance its earnings by being able to charge its advertisers a premium for being
able to more exactly and efficiently target the demographic segment they want to reach. Of course the increased
revenue from the any premium must be able to offset any revenue lost as advertisers stopped having to pay for
advertising for the segment they are not targeting. The interviewee could start the analysis by obtaining the
following information from the interviewer:
The only breakdown possible on your database is between subscribers who make under $50,000 and those who
make over $50,000.
There are 1 million readers, 80% of who are subscribers. Twenty-five percent of subscribers make under $50,000.
The same mix applies to the newsstand buyers according to readership audits.
Most advertisers are selling high-end fashion products, so 75% of them are targeting the high-income group.
The service is being offered to your client free for 3 years since the printer wants to promote the client’s use by
getting a major magazine to start using it. The client charges $50 per thousand per full-page and (selective binding
can be offered on full-page ads). Therefore revenue associated with a single inserted page (front and back) in an
issue is $100 per thousand.
The client’s closest direct competitor has 500,000 readers, 100% of who are subscribers. Effectively, all of their
readers make over $50,000. They charge $70,000 for their full one-page ads.
Since the printing cost to the client of selective binding is zero, the client simply needs to evaluate cost on the basis
of revenue per thousand gained or lost as their advertiser base uses the service to better target their ads to their
desired segment. Presumably, instead of 100% of advertisers paying the full $50/thousand per page, the 25% of
advertisers targeting the lower income segment will choose to advertise only to the 25% of subscribers falling into

that segment and the 75% of the advertisers targeting the high-income segment will advertise only to the high-
income subscribers (75% of subscribers). Assume that all advertisers continue to advertise in 100% of the

newsstand copies. The revenue effect of this change can be calculated by looking at the impact the change would
have on average ad rate per thousand on subscription readership:
New ad revenue per page = Old ad revenue per page X [(% low income subscribers X % low income target
advertisers) + (% high income subscribers X % high income advertisers)]
Thus,
New ad revenue per page at old rate = $50 X [(25% X 25%) + (75% X 75%)]
= $31.25 < $50
Now the question is, can ad rates per thousand on the selective binding portion of ads sold be increased sufficiently
to increase average revenue per thousand over what it is today? To answer this question, your client’s ad rates must
be looked at from the perspective of their advertisers. If you consider the advertisers targeting the high-income

group, their alternative to advertising in your client’s magazine is to put their ad dollars toward the 100% high-
income readership competitor. The cost per thousand high-income readers with the competitor magazine is:

(Page rate X total readership) / (portion of readers who are high income) = ($70 X 500,000) / 500,000 = $70
Thus $70 is the maximum price per thousand the client can charge its advertisers for selectively bound ads before
the advertisers would switch to their competitor. Note that currently, the client is cheaper buy for these high-income
advertisers even though they are paying to reach readers they do not want:
($50 X 1 million) / 750,000 = $66.67
If the client charged $70/thousand for selectively bound ads, average revenue per thousand to the client would be:
$70 X [($25 X $25) + ($75 X $75)] = $43.75
Since $43.75 is less than the $50 that advertisers are currently paying, the magazine should not be offering
advertisers the selective binding service.
Of course, there are other issues which interviewees might want to mention such as the possibility of price
discriminating between high- and low-income advertisers, the potential for and cost of expanding the advertising
base using selective binding as a selling tool, etc. However, it is important by the end of the interview to have
reached a recommendation regarding the initial regarding the initial question posed by the interviewer. To mention
these other possibilities and areas for further investigation is certainly worthwhile, but it is also important not to get
too far off track or to complicate the issue so much that a final recommendation is never reached."
"PHARMACY OUTLETS
Question:
Major discount retailer with over 1300 pharmacies. Pharmacy operations have had flat sales in a growing industry.
Profitability is very poor relative to industry. Chain has history of decentralized pricing and promotion for
pharmaceuticals, leading to strong autonomy in field operations, as well as widely inconsistent pricing. Customer
pricing complaints and customer attrition is chronic. New head of pharmacy operations has engaged us to “solve”
the pricing issue. How should we proceed?

Additional Information:
Case made up by someone who gave consulting interviews. Given the amount of information missing from the
initial set-up and discussion, there is a premium place on logical leaps and some intuition about customer behavior.","Possible Approach:
CUSTOMERS

Customers are generally older, repeat, discount-sensitive shoppers (as opposed to convenience-oriented
shoppers).
Customers may initially select a pharmacy on referral location or price.
Tend to build strong loyalty to pharmacy due to personal relation with pharmacist and high switching costs
(transfer of records etc).
Price tends to be a major factor, particularly given nature of customer (usually pay in cash from fixed
income) and trust relationship (i.e. price fluctuations are very damaging).
Inconsistent pricing on a given item may lead to price shopping, exposing all purchases to scrutiny, and
losing the customer.
PRICE
The client recommends a standard mark up from cost, with price matching to be determined by the
pharmacist at the store. As mentioned before, this leads to wildly different pricing from store to store, as
different pharmacists are vigilant to different degrees, regarding optimal pricing strategies.
COMPETITORS
Three main groups - chain drug stores, independent pharmacies, and discount chains with pharmacy
operations (Wal-Mart, Kmart). Client is in the “discount” group but competition is fierce between groups.
No pricing studies have been done.
NARROWING
Do a pricing study – How?
Select a market basket of items in commonly dispensed quantities, and call for prices from a selection of
competitors and our stores from across the country. Fine – it turns out that prices on high-volume items are
very erratic: from our prices at higher end to well below cost at some discounters. Less common items
display more consistent pricing across chains, with our pricing more or less in line.
Which items displayed the most aggressive pricing? Heart, diabetes, cholesterol and the like - basically higher cost, “maintenance” medications - those that someone has to take for the rest of their lives. Turns out,
customers are very sensitive to pricing on these items, as they represent a significant, unavoidable expense.
These are the items industry experts say are price shopped most commonly by customers.

Note - here the interviewer might suggest you design a pilot program to improve pricing, or you might be
prompted to give your insight on the information gathered to this point
Solution:
Test a pricing program where prices are set centrally for a number of stores in different markets. In this test,
set prices very aggressively for items identified as key items, and try to make up margins on non-key items.
Monitor results and adapt, and roll out if volume, profit warrant.
This is how most (good) retailer’s price. The hot items serve as loss leader, drawing traffic into the store for
general purchases, where money is made. In pharmacy in particular, it is important to be priced aggressively
in situations when many of your customers use case (vs. insurance) and where the customer with other health
care uses the item needs. Hence, heart and diabetes medications tend to be sold at or below cost in many
cases."
"EYESIGHT DRUG
Question:
A marketing vice-president of a major pharmaceutical firm is working on a business plan for a new revolutionary
product. The researchers have developed eye drops which completely eliminate near sightedness in 60% of the cases
(the cases caused by eye strain rather than irregularly shaped eye lenses) if the drops are used twice a day.
Part I
Problem: The client has been working on a business plan but is having a difficult time with one piece of information.
The client needs a directional estimate of the retail price they should set for the drops so that he can complete the

business plan. How would you help the client structure his thinking on the price and what is your back-of-the-
envelope estimate on the price that he should use in the business plan?

Part II
Problem: After talking through the pricing issue, the price of drops of $200 per year approx. is agreed with the
client. The client now wants to discuss another issue. The client needs to complete his baseline business plan within
an hour and share it with the management committee later in the afternoon. He wants to produce a ballpark estimate
of the market of the product. Specifically, what dollar level of sales might he be able to expect per year in the long
run in the U.S. market?","Possible Approach:
Part I

One rough cut pricing analysis would determine the market price for the product that is being replaced. . . in
this case eyeglasses or contact lenses. For example, if eyeglasses cost $120 and last on average 2 years, then
a two-year supply of drops could be sold for $120.
A more advanced analysis might determine that eye drops are simple to use and completely trouble-free so
that they should replace the most expensive option including all the costs associated with that option. For
example, this may include $100 per year in optometrists’ fees, $180 in contact lenses ($120 per pair, plus on
average, each user loses one lens in a year) and $25 in contact lens cleaning solution and other supplies, for a
grand total of $305. Using this example, the retail price of the one-year supply of drops should sell for $305.
The most advanced issue will include the fact that this new product is actually much better than the
alternatives, issues such as dynamics of pricing strategies (e.g. start high and reduce over time to best
understand elasticity), and pricing so that marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
Part II
Because you have already estimated a reasonable price, you must now estimate the number of yearly supplies that
the client can reasonably expect to sell in the U.S. One possible organizing structure (with estimates) is:
1. Estimate the number of people in the U.S. 250 million
2 Estimate the percentage of (1) using corrective eyewear 20%
3. Estimate the percentage of (2) that are nearsighted 70%
4. Use the client’s figures for the percentage of (3) that will be helped 60%
5. Estimate the percentage of people that will adopt the new product 40-60%
6. Put it all together (250*(.7)(.2)(.6)(.5) = 10.5 million
Multiply by price per (10.5) ($200 per unit) = 2.1 billion"
"ELECTRICITY POOL

Question:
Our client is a major British electricity utility. Currently, rates and returns are regulated, but a new proposal would
change the system to a more market-based pool system. The mechanics (simplified for case use) are as follows:
• Rather than each utility producing electricity for the use of its customers only (with excess or shortage
made up for in short-term contracts with other utilities or independent power producers), all utilities and
power producers will bid into a pool for power supply.
• Bidding for the purpose of this case can be assumed to (somehow) occur continuously - that is, if a supplier
decides to produce an amount of electricity (kilowatt-hours) at a certain, time, he bids that amount into the
pool.
• Bids will be arranged according to price, that is, the producer who bids in a the lowest price will have his
power used first, then the next highest price power will be used, etc.
• Demand will determine how much power gets taken from the pool at any time.
• The last unit of power purchased will be bought at the price it was bid into the pool at. All power sold at
that time will be sold at the price by the last unit. This can be thought of as a market-clearing price.
How would you evaluate this situation? At what price will /should people bid into the pool? What non-competitive
aspects might you expect from this system?","Possible Approach:
As with all economics questions, draw a graph first!
A supply / demand graph works quite nicely.

The demand side reflects the instant nature of demand - remember, the case said so. Keep in mind, power can be
thought of as pretty inelastic at any given point in time. The supply curve should be thought of as chunks of power
being bid into the pool at different quantities and prices.
The market clears at P*, as you might think, but keeping the mechanism of the pool in mind, the last guy only sells
part of what he bid in, and the next guy sells nothing. Note the large producer surplus for the guys who bid in low.
This is basically the only model you need to get all of the following points:
First, as in theory, the high-cost producer sets the market price. This would obviously raise concerns of price
fixing and collusion among few competitors. Lets put that aside for now and think about some other key
points.
People will bid in at their marginal cost of production. If you end up being the last guy in the pool who sells
power, you at least break even on a short run basis. If you turn out lower than anyone else, then you make
some money. I would propose that this equilibrium isn’t sustainable over the long haul, unless demand shifts
up and down enough to bring high-cost producers into the pool so I can get more than LRMC on average
(else I will shut down in the long run).
Also, this system places a huge premium on owning both high- and low-cost resources. Likewise, you must
understand patterns of demand. If you know a demand is coming up, bid both your high cost resource (to set
the price) and your low-cost resources (to make profit) into the pool. This brings in obvious collusion issues.
The extent to which the market disciplines gamesmanship and collusion depends to a large extent on those
strategic management issues we all forgot or didn’t have as first years - number and size of competitors, trade
associations, degree of communications, signaling mechanisms, and the like.
One might propose that the airline industry provides a good, similar model of deregulated industry (with
consumers getting all the benefits of an industry that bids SRMC for prices and loses money of the long haul
on huge fixed costs). On the other hand, telecommunications deregulation has produced high profits.
Overall, tire pool favors those with low cost resources. The wrinkle in electricity production is that the
lowest cost resources do not tend to be dispatch able, that is you have to run them all day long, if you run
them at all. (Hydroelectric and Nuclear plants are like this.) Implications? Many, including the fact that all
bidders know that you have to run your resource, and will assume you bid into the pool at zero. Also, if
everyone has these resources, during periods of slack demand, there will be no one to sell to at any price, and
the pool will clear at or near. That is why understanding (and modifying, if possible) demand is so critical..."
"Investment Decision Cases
NEW GLASS PLANT

Question:
A company has an existing glass plant and the scrap rate is 70% (yield is 30%). They are planning to build a new
plant. Should they use the existing technology from the old plant or should they implement non-implemented
technology in the new plant?
Additional Information:
If you work on the process in the old plant, you can get the yield in that plant up to 50%. This modification
will still not meet anticipated demand (i.e., you will still have to build a new plant)

If you build a new plant based on the old technology (now up to 50% yield), the two plants will meet current
demand. If demand increases, you will have to build a third plant.
Cost of the new facility is the same - regardless of the technology - but the plant cannot be retooled from one
technology to another without a significant investment.
No significant difference in the fixed or overhead costs associated with the two technologies.
The new technology was being run on a small-scale basis. Although the company is running this process
successfully on a small scale, they are worried about the fact that it has been untested in a full-scale
production environment.
Customers prefer the product manufactured with the new technology and will pay a price premium for this
product. Since no other companies have this technology, our company would be able to increase market
share if the new technology is chosen.","Possible Solution:
Establish that a new plant is really necessary: demand vs. capacity, improvements to current facilities,
possible alternatives such as outsourcing, etc. (in this case, they had determined that it was necessary to build
a new plant.)
Frame the decision by considering the two alternatives' cash flows and NPV. (Ask interviewer for specific
information needed.)
Benefits to the new technology include: increased market share, increased capacity, no need for 3rd plant,
ability to charge a price premium for new product.
Risks of new technology include: untested in a full production environment."
"ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS FOR PAPER
Question:
JPC Chemicals has been approached to buy a start-up company with a new environmental technology (Enviroclean).
Technology is machinery-based, but uses some chemistry (similarly to JPC’s); installations cost from $2.5
million depending on paper machine size.
System “closes the mill,” removing ~100% of effluents:
Some is reclaimed and made into paper.
Remainder can be disposed as solid waste or burned.
Additional Information:
System requires either an on-site engineer or extensive customer training.
Price for Enviroclean is $100 million (firm).
Marketing concept is monthly fee based on size of installation and utilization.","Solution:
An acceptable answer should determine that revenue potential (i.e. demand, price structure) is critical to making an
acquisition case.
1. Recognize the need to size the market potential (how many mills, how big) and estimate likely demand
(customer benefits – regulatory needs, value of reclaimed material, etc., and alternatives)
2. Set up basic NPV analysis to underpin business case
3. Identify risk of buying new-to-the-world technology
A better response will recognize the synergies available from the paper chemical provider and potential advantages
of ownership:
1. Access to accounts already served reduces marketing costs and, possibly, cost-to-serve.
2. Potential chemical sales “lock-ins” creating razor-and-blade marketing of environmental chemistry
3. Competitive advantages of winning way into new mills where JPC does not sell chemicals currently (and
vice-versa for a competitor acquisition of Enviroclean)
An outstanding response recognizes the potential to overcome the high acquisition price and to create value
creatively:
1. Create a price structure which offsets capital outlay for new installations (e.g., up-front payment of 1⁄2 capital
plus annual management fee).
2. Option to sell equipment or technology to other companies outside JPC competitive arena (e.g., Europe,
North American) or buy jointly with non-complete agreements.
3. Opportunity to form marketing alliance with Enviroclean (e.g., account introduction/marketing for JPC
chemical specification)."
"CHINA CO.

Question:
The CEO of a large diversified building products company has asked us to help him examine the operations of his
china products division. China products include tubs, toilets, and urinals. Specifically, he wants to know if he should
approve a $200 million capital expenditure for new manufacturing facilities. The company is:

One of seven producers in the United States: largest producer has 20%, our client is number three with 15%.
Prices for the client’s products have been flat.
The two largest competitors appear to earn a small return, our client is to break even.
The largest competitor has just announced plans for a major modern plan.
What issues must be considered?","Possible Approach:
MARKETING
How rational has pricing been in the industry?
Have competitors ever announced capacity expansions before and then not implemented them?
Are there opportunities to rationalize the product line?
Does the new finish that will result from the investment “pay for itself” with higher prices?
COMPETITIVE POSITION
How important is the product line to each competitor?
Are the products sold in combination (with each other or with other products such as fittings)?
Would exiting this business affect the sales, profits or cost of the other business units?
Are there advantages to plants being located in specific places due to high transportation cost?
If the competitor’s new plant is built, will other competitors exit?
EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
Is regulation important?
Are there changing demographics that will affect demands?
CUSTOMER
Do customers demand a full line supplier? (for example if other building products are required)?
Is any significant portion of sales to single customers (e.g. Sears)?
BARRIERS TO ENTRY OR EXIT
What is the minimum efficient size for the new plant?
How expensive is entry or exit? Has there been a history of change in the industry players?
MANUFACTURING
Do the plants produce other products or contribute to overhead?
Are there ways in which costs can be substantially lowered?
CLARIFY
Is the planned investment expected to lower costs? (Yes, but not substantially, because the new process will
result in a better finish.)
Does the company rely on a limited source of raw materials? (No, as the materials are easy to get.)
Has the market been growing? (Market is linked to new housing.)
Is there overcapacity in this market?
What are the competitors’ relative cost positions?
Market segmentation - residential vs. industrial vs. commercial.
Price points - cheap vs. expensive / quality."
"LUMBER COMPANY

Question:
A turnaround specialist has retained your services to help him evaluate a medium-sized lumber company as a
potential acquisition. How would you determine whether the acquisition is worthwhile?
Additional Information:
4 Because most of the company’s products are sold to the construction industry, it faces cyclical demand.
4 Most of the company’s production facilities are fully depreciated and somewhat antiquated.
4 Some reduction in workforce will be necessary to achieve levels of efficiency on par with the best in the
industry.
4 The company has extensive holdings of forests. The historical ROI for these assets has been 16%. This is
actually less than the company’s cost of capital of 18%. If the company were acquired, some of the acreage
of forests could be sold. This would 1) provide cash to fund capital improvements, and 2) improve ROA.
4 The potential exists to placate environmentalists and improve operating efficiency by 1) increasing
selectivity in tree cutting, and 2) upgrading process machinery to peel trees more efficiently.","Possible Approach:
Ultimately, the decision of whether to acquire the company should be based on a conservative assessment of
1) Market potential – can the company expand into other industries to remove cyclicality and increase sales?
2) The potential to improve the company’s operations – will investments in new machinery improve efficiencies
while providing tax shields for higher cash flows? Will infusion of fresh equity reduce the cost of capital?
What’s the debt level – can we renegotiate the interest rates? , and
3) Predicted competitive reaction.
Because of the cyclicality of the industry, it is particularly important to look at downside and upside scenarios.
Sales below projections will be a problem, but sales growth higher than expected may also be a problem if
the company ends up starved for working capital."
"Question:
A producer of glass containers is considering making a $1 million investment to upgrade some process equipment.
Would you recommend that they do so?

Additional Information:
This company has only one, albeit large, facility. There are quite a few other glass producers.
Margins and profits of the entire industry have been eroding for several years.
There has been and continues to be some cannibalization by plastic and metals. However, glass remains the
material of choice for many applications, especially food products.
The main input material, sand, is inexpensive and plentiful.
Some of this company’s competitors have already made a similar upgrade to their own process equipment.
The key insight in this case is to recognize the high competitive intensity in this industry. The profit
potential, at least in the short term, appears poor.
Given the fact that there are too many players and too little profit, some consolidation and/or exit of some
companies from the industry appears inevitable. This company must decide whether it is worth it to try to
ride out this shakeout.
At least in the short term, the return on the $1 million investment will likely not be adequate to justify.
However, one interesting possible justification for making the investment might be to “dress up” the
company in order to sell it.","Approach
1. Why are we thinking of making the $1 million investment?
Step 1: Hypothesis:
• To gain revenues or
• to reduce costs or
• both and hence increase profitability
Step 2: Explore the hypothesis.
A. To gain revenue:
• Increase volume or increase price of both.
• Ask questions centered around the product, market, competition, substitutability, market share etc.
• Make sure to concentrate on the past and the present. E.g. what has our market share been in the past 3
years.
• Also remember to concentrate on what is happening in the industry per se. Is the total pie
growing/shrinking/the same? Any new products which can substitute ours?
B. To reduce costs:
• Ask questions about existing operations, cost of making a sq. foot of glass
• Competitor/industry costs,
• Industry margins, our margins etc and how this new technology might help us. Try to find how this
technology will help us save operational costs.

Step 3: Zero in on the core issue.
• E.g. our quality is suffering, hence our volumes are decreasing, if we don’t act now, we will keep losing
market share, hence we need to invest.
• At the same time, test whether we really need to remain in the business. E.g. if the industry is shrinking,
new products are coming in, there might not be any point in investing. In this case, would it be better off to
invest in another project?
• Explore various viewpoints, but keep on narrowing down and then offer a recommendation with a backup
plan. (A 30 second synthesis at the end, leave out the case facts, just how you came up with the
recommendation). Start by saying, “I recommend that we .....because....and...and...”."
"MANUFACTURING PLANT

Question:
A corn feed company has eight manufacturing plants located in the Midwest. These plants service the entire United
States. Their plant in Ohio is in need of refurbishing. The company has four possible options:
1. Refurbish the existing plant
2. Build a larger plant at the current location
3. Build a similar size plant at a new location
4. Build a larger plant at a new location
Which is the best option for this plant?","Approach:
There are two issues to this decision. The plant size and the plant location should be considered separately.
Size of Plant:
The first consideration is the demand for the product.
Corn feed is a commodity product. Pricing on the product is dependent on current corn prices as opposed to
the manufacturing process.
There are four main competitors – our company is the second largest. All four competitors have similar
manufacturing processes and similar cost structure.
The purposed larger plant will not give economies of scales not currently present at the existing plant.
The capacity utilization is 65% which is industry standard.
The current customers buy from all four manufacturers in order to guarantee supply.
Currently demand is being met and there are no alternative uses for corn feed.
Conclusion: The only way to increase demand for corn feed and support a larger plant is through the reduction of
the price per ton. This price reduction will be matched by all competitors and reduce the profitability of the industry.
Best option is to maintain the current size of the manufacturing plant.
Location of Plant:
Transportation cost and perishability are the main issues with location. The transportation cost for the corn stock
(raw material) is much higher than the cost of transporting the actual feed. The corn is gown in the Ohio area and the
feed is sold to the East Coast. The raw material is perishable where as the corn feed can be stored for any length of
time and easier to transport. Cost analysis of the transportation cost of feed versus raw materials should be
completed. Included in this analysis would be the % of spoilage for longer transportation of corn stock.
Conclusion: The current plant is located close to the cornfields and this is the best location for the plant from the
cost/benefit analysis."
"COMPANY ACQUISITION

Question:
A client approaches you with a very open-ended question. He owns a large branched bank in Texas and wants to
reduce his exposure to the banking business. With $100 million in losses, he hopes to find a new business to acquire,
against which he can offset these losses. If the transaction is executed properly, you can carry forward losses from
the banking business, over the next 15 years, reducing/eliminating the taxes you’d pay on the profitable business that
you have acquired.","Possible Approach:
• Does he have any particular area of interest or expertise? No, except in banking which he specifically wants
to avoid.
• Given the substantial size of the losses, he needs to find a company that will generate almost immediate
profits on a rather grand scale. This pretty much rules out any start-ups.
• From the IRS perspective, can the new business be a foreign one? Good question, I haven’t explored that
route yet.
• It would he great if he could use the bank as an advantage - leverage it. What about hooking up with some
multi-media company - the whole banking at home concept? Interesting. . .
Microsoft would be great - I doubt Bill Gates would sell. But that company offers him what he needs: profits on a
big scale, future growth, something new and different. He could also look at mortgage-backed securities - a firm like
Freddie Mac with profits in the tens of millions."
"AUSTRALIAN SKI SALES

Question:
A ski manufacturer (snow-skis) has developed a revolutionary new ski technology. You, knowing very
little about skis, have stumbled across them, and have seen a chance to become the Australian distributor
for the product. You are meeting them in 30 minutes and have to come up then with an estimate of the
number of skis sold in Australia annually.","Possible Approach
• Since there are roughly five (5) major Australian ski resort areas, estimated capacity at about 5000
skiers each, season is about 12 weeks, most ski for one week, total is about 250,000 skiers.
• Estimated ski life is 5 years, therefore 50,000 skis/year sold in Australia.
• Hiring vs. owning makes little difference."
"FRIDGE LIGHT

Question:
Tell me all the ways, practical or not, which you could use to determine whether the light goes off in a
refrigerator, when you close the door.

Additional Information:

• After I came up with about 5 responses, the interviewer actually said that my performance was
adequate (of course implying that he’d recommend me for the next round) however, he wanted to
continue searching for answers “just for fun.”
• When we were done, I asked him if anyone else came up with interesting answers that I didn’t
mention he gave two.
• Pick up the phone, dial the manufacturer and ask if the light goes off when you close the door.
• If no one is in there to see the light go off, does it matter? (for those of you unfamiliar with
this philosophical angle, it was originally stated as “if a tree falls in the forest and no one
hears it, does it make any noise?) I acknowledged that I wouldn’t have thought of that one in a
million years, but it definitely shows some tremendous creativity. He agreed.

","Possible Approach
A random list of answers that ended working:
• With the door open, press the button that makes the light go on and off.
• Drill a hole in the door so that you can see inside when the door is closed.
• Find out the mean time to failure for these bulbs, close the door and open it after the expiration
time to see if the light is burned out.
• Go to the production line, and perform a statistically valid test (appropriate number of samples) to
determine whether the light always goes off (by pressing the button, etc.)
• Hook wires to the socket and perform a similar test when the door is closed.
• Place a sensitive thermometer (chilled to the refrigerator’s temperature before testing) near the
light bulb and close the door.
• Place some light sensitive material in the refrigerator to see if it is activated."
"MOUNT FUJI

Question:
The government of Japan has employed us to find out how to move Mt. Fuji 100Km North. How would you
approach this?

Additional Information:
The interviewer then says, ""OK, that's great information; but let's just suppose that moving the mountain is the best
thing to do in this scenario. What would you do then?""","Approach:
The key here is to not dive right into answering the question. Stop and think before progressing - Why does the
government want to move Mt. Fuji?
It turns out that that tourism to the mountain is down. The government wants to increase tourism and thought that if
the mountain were closer to Tokyo, more people would come.
Think about alternatives:
• Offer cheap package tours to Mt. Fuji from Tokyo and Osaka.
• Lower road tolls if people are going to Mt. Fuji via car.
• Increase local and international advertising about the national treasure.
• Increase the frequency of trains to the mountain.
• Offer new attractions (more hotels, amusement parks, games, rides, super traditional restaurants, etc.)

Approach:
The question now becomes a straight operations / optimization, guestimation case.
Estimate the volume of a cone and then start estimating the labor and machines needed to move the mountain.
Additionally, bring in labor (the more labor employed will help the national unemployment statistics)."
"RECYCLED ALUMINIUM
Question:
You are in a meeting with a client who mentions that she is considering building a new plant. The new
plant will require 100 million tons per year of recycled aluminum as an input. Your client turns to you and
asks you if there is 100 million tons of recycled aluminum available in the U.S. on a yearly basis. You do
not have that information at the top of your head. How can you answer the question on the spot?

Additional Information:
• Don’t make the math too difficult for yourself. It is acceptable and very wise to round off. For
example, I used 17.5 cans in a pound and 350 days in a year as they are close enough and they
make the calculations easier.
• Don’t forget to state your assumptions - there are several assumptions you’ll have to make to
come to an answer. Make sure you state what they are. It is better to make an assumption that
you are not sure of than to stop and not to get an answer. Once you have an answer, it is perfectly
acceptable, and advisable to say “I’ve made several assumptions to come to this answer. One I am
not sure of is my assumption about how many cans make up a pound. I said 17.4 cans are in a
pound. If there were really twice that many, I would have to adjust my numbers accordingly. Of
course that would not change my bottom line answer. There would still not be enough recycled
aluminum.","Possible Approach
• I know that soda cans are made of aluminum. Let’s assume that soda cans are the major source of
recycled aluminum. Also, let’s assume that people drink 5 cans of soda per day.
• 350 days / year x 5 cans / day / person = 1,750 cans per year per person.
• Let’s assume there are 17.5 cans in a pound of aluminum.
• That means there are 100 pounds of aluminum per year per person.
• There are 250 million people in the United States.
• That means that there are 25,000 million pounds per year.
• Since 2,000 pounds = 1 ton, there are only 12.5 million tons of recycled aluminum available per
year.
Thus there is not enough recycled aluminum available per year in the United States."
"U.S. GAS STATIONS

Question:
How many gas stations are there in the U.S.?

Additional Information:
Given the interview conditions, it is worthwhile picking relatively easy numbers to work with rather than
getting caught up in some highly complex mental arithmetic.","Possible Approach
There are two ways I thought of to approach this question:
• Population theory - In say, Menlo Park / Atherton, there are about 15 gas stations for about 40,000
people. In urban areas, there are many more people per gas station (say 150 in San Francisco for
700,000 people), while in rural areas, there are fewer people per station (in my hometown, there
were three (3) gas stations for about 5,000 people). Add in a Fudge factor for truck stops in the
middle of nowhere, and let’s guesstimate that the average nation-wide (I know one isn’t supposed
to average averages, but this is consulting) is about as populated with stations as Menlo Park This
is a ratio of one station per 2,667 people. There are 250 million people in the U.S. so that’s
around 90,000 stations.
• Note - one could just have used Menlo Park from the start, but the idea is not to get the answer but
to think transparently. I threw in things like urban areas, people without cars, commercial
transport etc to show that I was casting a net to test the reasonableness of my assumptions,
regardless of the fact that I finished where I started.
• Two (2) - Patterns of demand and a little knowledge - My idea of the average gas station has 8
pumps. I have observed that, on average, four (4) pumps are in use during the 14 hours a day the
station (average station) is open. Let’s guess that the average station sells (14 hours x 6 fills / hr x
4 pumps x 10 gallons of gas) i.e., 3,360 gallons of gas / day. That’s around 1.2 million gallons per
year. Now, I know that all of the U.S. could fit into the front seats of all of the cars in the U.S., so
lets assume there are 125 million cars on the road. If each car is driven for 12,000 miles at 20
miles per gallon, that implies (125 million x 12,000 miles/20mpg) i.e. 75 billion gallons of gas are
consumed each year. Therefore 75 billion gallons / 1.2 million gallons / station / year - 62,500
stations.
• Note - I know that this is convoluted but more elegant solutions are available.
• Last I heard 80,000 or so. Remember the idea is not to get the right answer but to think logically,
in a linear fashion, and net to a reasonable answer. That is 1 million stations is obviously too
many where 1,000 is probably the number you personally have been to in your life."
"HEATHROW PASSENGERS

Question:
How many passengers go through Heathrow each year?","Possible Approach:
Interviewer not looking for the real number, but the process through which you arrive at it! Therefore you make
assumptions.
I assumed:
• People going through Heathrow = Arrivals and Departures.
• Assume one plane lands and one plane leaves every 30 seconds.
• Assume airport is operational 365 days a year, and for 21 hours a day.
• Ask the interviewer what is the average passenger capacity of the planes (both arrivals and departures), e.g.
200.
• Ask if for example, 75% load rate is a fair assumption.
• You can then calculate the number.
Check that we ignored the double-counting issue of transient passengers (i.e. the same passengers both arrive and
leave the airport - the interviewer hadn’t considered this).
Keep the numbers simple when doing this - the actual number does not matter as much as the process."
"MILLIONAIRE
Question:
Our client is a programming director for network television. She has been approached with the concept for a new
prime-time game show where contestants have the opportunity to win one million dollars through answering a series
of trivia questions. How would you help the programmer evaluate the opportunity?","Possible Approach:
Clearly the game show models ABC’s popular Who Wants to Become a Millionaire? franchise. In general, starting
with a profitability framework will help structure the analysis, but creative-thinking and an understanding of
industry drivers will lead to differentiated answers.

Many of the critical decisions which impact revenue have yet to be determined, and the consultant’s
recommendation should recognize and support choices that maximize the probability of success. The two
immediate revenue streams are commercial advertising and in-show product promotion. Clearly the producer
also has incentives to foster successful shows, as this will enhance the fees garnered from syndication.
Finally, a great answer will address network effects across the programming schedule (i.e., a blockbuster
program in one time slot will have spill-over effects into adjacent programming).
A good answer will examine the chain of factors that lead to strong revenue. Popularity (as measured in
weekly television ratings like Nielson) often directly correspond to the number of advertising spots and the
dollars per 30 second spot that the show can command. However, ratings are a complex instrument.
Certainly having a good product is essential to good ratings. But there are choices in the product definition –
go after the mass market with generic questions, or a more targeted approach with sports trivia, yuppie trivia,
etc. Mass market obviously has the larger potential, but a case could be made for significant capture of a
targeted, demographically-attractive (18-34 year old male) audience. Another important decision point is
time slot within the programming schedule, which dictates size of audience, competition, and network lineup.
The second half of the success equation are costs. A good answer will identify the various components of
cost in game show such as this – fixed production costs, promotion and marketing, opportunity cost of other
programming to be developed, etc. The two most interesting cost components are the choice of host (talent)
and the payout equation. For talent, the tradeoff lies among absolute cost and fit with target demographic
(which translates into revenue potential). ABC obviously chose Regis Philbin, who likely commands a
significant salary but also appeals to a wide audience and has established credibility / marketability. A more

targeted, niche show would seek different characteristics. Alternatively, the producer could choose a no-
name host, save salary costs, and hope the product itself sells. Secondly, the math behind the contestant

payoff should be explored. An obvious realization is that the mean payout is significantly less than $1
million, as most contestants will answer incorrectly well before that. However, the producer will need to
weigh saving money on the payout with a decline in audience interest (if the questions are so difficult that no
one ever wins the million, it’s likely enthusiasm would wane).
Conclusion:
At minimum, the consultant should break down the revenue and cost factors that will influence the program’s
success. Better answers will present an integrated recommendation, recognizing the connection points between
choice of host / payout / timeslot / adjacent programming and success through targeted demographic, high ratings,
and profitable advertising. Additional creative responses will acknowledge the positive impact of a successful,
headline game show on the network’s entire schedule (audience retention, promotion of complementary
programming, etc.)."

This problem requires a detailed analysis of the cruise ships logistics. Specifically, an analysis of the loading and
unloading of the ship is required. Begin by gaining an understanding of the problem.

How long are they in port? What is the layout of the port? Of the ship? What problems are they currently
having?
Then analyze the specifics of the loading and unloading process (i.e. the supply chain).
What are they loading and unloading from the ship? Where are they getting the supplies? Exactly how do
the supplies get on the ship? Who is doing the loading and unloading?
You should be trying to determine any bottlenecks in the system!!!
Once you’ve identified the bottlenecks, make recommendations for addressing them. Look for creative solutions or
alternative processes!
Solution:
In this particular case you would have discovered a number of bottlenecks. Specifically, you would have
determined that the loading and unloading of the ship is limited by time (8 hours); port layout (only room for one
truck at a time); number of suppliers (purchase directly from individual producers vs. from one wholesaler); and
ship layout (most used supplies are not easily accessible).
Recommendations might have included using a wholesaler to minimize the number of trucks entering the port;
redesigning the storage of supplies on the ship to put the most used supplies near the loading door; increasing the
number of fork trucks; and using other ports of call of the ship for loading and unloading of some of the materials."
"CONSTRUCTION COMPANY

Question:
You are a consultant advising a construction company. The major line of business for your client is road
construction. They have recently entered into the building construction. In past they have grown through
Acquisitions. The COO has hired you to help them increase ROA.","Possible Approach:
While you are gathering your thoughts about the questions you are going to ask the interviewer, think of the
components in ROA. The numerator is Income and denominator is Assets. So there are two ways you can increase
the ROA. You either increase the income or decrease the Asset. You can do both if you want. Now that you have
identified the drivers, you can start asking questions to narrow your options.

You can start with asking the questions about ROA
• How does ROA compared to your competitors?
• Has it been so low for ever? Has it been going down? Any trends?
Ans : Competitors have better ROA than us. When we started it was good but then it has been going continuously
down.
This gives you an idea that the problem is with the company and not with the Industry
Now you can ask questions about the components of their income statement, one of the drivers of ROA
• What is your profit margin?
• How does it compare to the competitors?
• Has the revenues gone up or down recently?
• How does your COGS as % of revenue.
Ans : Our profit margins have been almost equivalent to those of competitors. We have not seen any drop in
revenues it has been growing with the market. On the cost side we are not much off but there may be some
opportunities.
This gives you an opening in the cost structure. Ask more questions
• If you don’t know about the Industry ask about the cost structure in the Industry
• What is the labor cost?
• What are the other major costs from Raw Material perspective?
Ans : Labor costs are competitive . Major raw materials for us are concrete, crushed stone, steel etc. Is their any
other cost you can think of.
This gives you an idea about the raw materials, can you do something to reduce that cost. Think of the other costs
involved. Once you have analyzed these you are done with the Cost and revenue part of it.
Next focus on the Assets.
• Is there a way to reduce that?
What they are looking for:
If you just focused on the income statement, you did 25% job. The real issue was with the Assets. And the key to
answering the questions is to listen to the question carefully. Company has been growing through acquisitions. As a
result of that they had too many buildings, offices, equipments that were not utilized. They have just acquired it and
it has been sitting on their balance sheet. You should have been able to at least ask questions about that and then the
interviewer will lead you to the solution. The solution was to sell some of these unutilized assets. On the revenue
side you also needed to touch on fact that they have started getting into a building construction. Is this a good
business, how are they doing there. It turns out that they had a high profit margin for this set of business. To increase
revenue they can increase the business in this area. On the cost side, the way to reduce the raw material cost was to
vertically integrate with the stone crushers , as that was the major part of their raw material and owning that will
help reduce cost."

"Southwright Med Device
Prompt
A medical equipment manufacturer in the southeastern U.S. has called you in because it feels its
working capital requirements are much higher than those of its competitors. How will you help it
solve its problem?

Guidance
This is a financial accounting case focused on a medical device company. The discussion should be
conversational but exacting on details. There are no handouts so the candidate should rely on the
general data given/created by the interviewer. The basic objective of this case is to test knowledge
of the Balance Sheet and how it applies to business operations.
Read this information well before you administer the case. Manage the case discussion and allow
the candidate to formulate a plan based on the assumptions and key evidence provided below
(case-specific). Offer prompts when necessary and provide the following information if he/she
responds correctly and directly to the stimulus offered.
CA & CL: Let the candidate identify the need of Current Assets (CA) and Current Liabilities (CL).
Provide this information on request: ―Current assets consist of cash, inventory, and accounts
receivable and current liabilities consist of accounts payable and short term debts.‖
Company: Provide this information if the candidate asks for the background of the company:
The company is made up of three divisions. The high inventory problem can be traced to a division
acquired by the client about two years ago. The division manufactures equipment for arthroscopic
surgery, namely capital equipment and blades which sell are similar to razors and razor blades, just
much more sophisticated and expensive.
Inventory: If the candidate asks about inventory and indicates that the inventory could be very high,
prompt him/her to discuss possible reasons for inventories to be high.
An ideal answer would consist of: sales, poor forecasting, obsolescence.
If the candidate asks for the reasons for inventory problem, explain to the candidate that technology
has been changing rapidly and the rate of obsolescence is extremely high. As earlier sales forecasts
(shortly after the acquisition) had been overly optimistic, the client now finds itself loaded with
obsolescent finished goods inventory. Then ask the candidate to recommend correction actions to
remedy the problem.
An ideal recommendation should touch upon these points:
Determine appropriate levels of inventory such that excess inventory is reduced and
customer demands are met.
 Factors that should be considered - Product demand, manufacturing lead times, customer
expectations on order lead times.

Prompt –
Part II
The client has 2.5 years of capital equipment finished goods inventory while NONE needs to be
carried since these items can be manufactured after receiving the order (i.e. The finished good
product is no longer sold.) What are the next steps?

Guidance
An ideal answer would look like this:
With respect to technology, while certain aspects of the product may have changed substantially,
other are just as likely to have stayed similar to what was previously used and could be salvaged.
One could dismantle the product and reuse parts to manufacture the new devices. Selling off the
inventory to distributors in less advanced healthcare markets is another way to salvage some of the
investment. Alternately write off the non salvageable component parts.

"Polly Publishing
Prompt
Your client is the CEO of a publishing company producing a line of educational magazines and a line
of women's magazines. Both businesses are profitable but not growing quickly. He wants to start a
third monthly magazine in the US targeted at 25- to 55-year-old men (e.g. GQ Magazine). His stated
goal is $12 million in circulation revenues in the first year. Is this possible?

Guidance
This is a market estimation case. The case is based off estimations and the candidate‘s ability to
work with those estimations. While there are no right/wrong answers in market estimation cases, the
interviewer usually has a range of  ̳correctness‘, if you will. The candidate‘s answer should fall within
interviewer‘s estimate to the extent that your assumptions are realistic.
Ask the candidate to walk you through his thought process – top-down, bottom-up. Once his /her
structure is in place, ask him/her to compute the calculation. Various methods may be used to
estimate the answer; one approach is outlined below.

Analysis
Provide these information on request:
 The total US population is approximately 300 million.
 Based on a normal distribution with the average life span of 80 years, approximately 1/2 of the
population falls between 25-55, or about 150 million people.
 Approximately 1/2 of them are male, or 75 million.
 Of the 75 million 25- to 55-year-old men in the country, assume that at least 1/2 would read a
magazine or ~40 million.
 Given the wide range of magazines on the market assume that only 10% of magazine readers
would want to read a men's journal, or 4 million target customers.
 As a new magazine assume that you can generate a 5% share of the men's magazine market in
year one, or 200,000 customers.
 Based on other magazines selling for $2.50-$5.00, assume a cover price of $4/magazine at the
newsstand and $2/magazine for a subscription.
 Now make some assumptions on how many customers will buy at the newsstand versus
subscription: assume 50% subscribe (100,000 customers) and 50% buy at the newsstand
(100,000 customers).
Monthly revenues amount to $200,000 (subscription) + $400,000 (newsstand) = $600,000.
For simplicity assume that all target customers buy a magazine every month.
This would generate total annual revenues of $600,000 X 12 or $7.2 million.
Conclusion: In this case, given the CEO's stated goal of $12 million in circulation revenues, it does
not make good business sense to launch the magazine.","Performance

How many piano tuners are there in Chicago?

Guidance

Ask the candidate to walk you through his thought process top-down,
bottom-up. Once his /her structure is in place, ask him/her to compute the calculation.
Various methods may be used to estimate the answer.

Analysis

One approach to solve the problem:
Assume 3 million households in the Chicago area. Make an estimate of how many people have
pianos. Break the income of the households into four quarters (750,000 each).
 20% of highest income quartile has pianos
 10% of second quarter
 5% of third
 0% of fourth
Estimate how often these pianos are tuned:
 Highest income quarter tunes pianos once a year
 Second quarter once every five years
 Third quarter once every 10 years
 Fourth quarter doesn‘t tune at all

Estimate a piano tuner can tune five pianos a day, 250 days a year
Therefore 112,500/250 = 450 pianos a day to tune 450/5 = 90 pianos tuners needed.
Sanity Check: The yellow pages would be a credible source to check the actual number of piano
turners in Chicago. Also it is fair to add another 50% to that figure assuming that some piano turners
might rely on word-of-mouth advertising. By the way there are 51 piano tuners listed in the Chicago

"Scotch Bar
Prompt

You are sitting in one of Chicago's oldest scotch bars with a fellow intern. It is a Friday night after a
busy week at your summer internship. The weather is mild—a perfect summer evening. While
enjoying one of the bar's finest stogies and sipping an 18-year old McCallen single malt, your friend
asks you how much you think the bar is worth. Using a back-of-the-envelope calculation, how would
you go about determining the value of this bar?

Guidance

This is an estimation case. Because the candidate does not know much about the bar he/she
should ask for details. To estimate cash flow, a ―Revenue – Cost‖ framework is useful. The value of
the bar is the present value of future cash flows.
The following information should be given if requested:
 Product Mix and Pricing: The bar sells two things, liquor and cigars. The average cost of a cigar
is $9 and the average cost of a drink is $12. (Note: these average cost numbers will prove
irrelevant, but in cases one is sometimes given irrelevant info.)
 Capacity: The maximum capacity is 100 people.
 Location: The bar is located on one of Chicago's busier streets for foot traffic.
 Hours: The bar is open Tuesday thru Sunday from 5 pm until 2 am.
 Staff: A bartender, a waiter, and a waitress. All three were there the entire evening.
 Tax Rate: 40%
 Discount Rate: 13%
 Annual Growth Rate of Cash Flows: 3%
The candidate will most likely not ask for all of this information upfront. Allow the candidate to make
some assumptions about revenues. One way to project revenues is to estimate the number of
customers per day or per week and multiply that by the average expenditure of each customer.
Watch for realistic assumptions and logical thought progression.

Prompt –
part II

Ask the candidate what might drive variation in these numbers. The answer is days of the week
(Fridays and Saturdays are typically busier than other days) and seasonality (people tend to be out
more during summer than winter).

Guidance

While the candidate talks you through his/her approach, but before the candidate does a substantial
amount of calculation, hand the candidate Exhibit 1. If the candidate does the math correctly, the
revenue should add up to $568,000.

The candidate should then proceed to costs. There are two components: fixed costs and variable
costs. Have the candidate brainstorm possible fixed costs and variable costs. Under fixed costs the
candidate might consider rent, general maintenance, management, insurance, liquor license, and
possibly employees. The only real variable cost is the cost of goods sold. Allow the candidate to
brainstorm costs before revealing the following data:
Variable costs are 20% of total revenues, and fixed costs are $120,000.
After the candidate has subtracted costs from revenues, he/she should have an income of $334,400.
Do not forget that we need the after-tax cash flow number (approximately $334,000 * (1-40%)) =
$200,400 (or $200,000 for ease of calculation in next prompt). You now have the annual cash flows
generated by the bar.
At this point a great candidate will drive the process forward and recognize that they need to figure out
a stream of cash flows going forward. The interviewer may have to nudge less-savvy candidates
toward the next step (discounted cash flow analysis).

Prompt How does one perform a valuation of the business?

Analysis

To perform a valuation in this case, the candidate must estimate the cash flows from the business and
discount them back using a perpetuity formula. The discount rate typically used for bars of this genre
is 13%. When the candidate inquires about growth rates, say the bar‘s cash flow is growing at 3%--
the rate of inflation. Thus, whatever numerator the candidate arrives at should be divided by .13 - .03
= .10, an easy calculation. Use the CF / (r – g) formula for a perpetuity.
In this case, the answer is around $200,000 / .10, or $2 million.

Exhibit 1: Daily sales

Fridays and Saturdays Rest of Week

Spring and Summer $4,800 16 2/3% of Fri and Sat,

"Chemical Brothers Int.
Prompt

Your client Chemical Brothers International (CHEMBRO), is a major chemical producer, has
retained your firm‘s services to evaluate the feasibility of acquiring another major player in the
industry, Plastics of America (POA). Both companies are bulk commodity chemical producers.
Your task is to analyze the future prospects of POA‘s major product line, a chemical used in the
production of plastics. Should Chembro acquire POA?

Guidance

There are two issues in this case that should be addressed separately in the suggested order:
1. What issues need to be addressed in evaluating an M&A proposal? Qualitative
2. What is the valuation? Quantitative

Prompt –
Part II

What strategic issues need to be addressed in evaluating an M&A proposal?

Guidance

The idea here is to get a sense of the candidates‘ business judgment and whether or not he/she is
able to apply correct frameworks to diagnose the issue at hand.
A strong candidate will recognize that this case deals with internal factors (synergies and economies
of scale) as well as some external factors (opportunity costs and industry attractiveness). The
candidate should include some of the following elements in his framework:
 Market Attractiveness / Industry Potential
 Operational Analysis (Synergies/Economies of Scale/ Network Externalities)
 Organizational and cultural compatibility
 Capability to enact acquisition: Financial, legal, and perceptual barriers

Analysis

The candidates framework should cover the following buckets. Allow the candidate to ask for
information about the major categories before giving the information. If the candidate is missing one
of the buckets, prompt them with a question to get them on track.
Market Analysis
 End-users come primarily from the automotive industry
 Market size has been slowly declining over the last five years
 Within the last couple of years, prices have declined rapidly
Competition / Industry Analysis
 There are 10 major producers; the largest one with a 35% share; number two has 25%, and POA
is third with 20%; the remaining share is divided amongst others
 The two largest competitors earn a small return; POA is slightly above break-even; the rest are
operating at break-even or at a loss
 Relative capacity utilization in the industry is 60 to 70 % and has been so for the last 3 years.
POA is also currently working at 75% of capacity
 The two largest competitors are highly diversified with this particular product line representing no
more than 20% of their revenues
 Highly regulated industry with expensive pollution control equipment
 High barriers to entry because of the low profits and high investments required
Product value proposition / brand portfolio
 The price has been driven by self-destructive cuts from the leaders to gain temporary share
points
 We do not foresee the development of any significant byproducts.
 Other possible uses: None.
 Complementary Assets: 50% of POA‘s sales are to the automobile industry

Finance and Operations
 Cost is based on size/efficiency/age of plant, etc. Within the industry, POA is in an above average
position.
 There are several operational improvements that could be implemented, and management has
not been aggressive in its pursuit of quality and cost controls.
 Great economies of scale exist in marketing and transportation. (Not quantifiable)
 Operational synergies could represent an additional $30 million in profits

Prompt –
Part III

After discussing the above-mentioned qualitative aspects in some detail, provide the candidate with
Exhibit 1 when the conversation shifts to the topic of valuation.
Ask candidate to compute the present value of acquisition.

Guidance

You may allow the candidate to use 10% rate of return and not 9% (12% Return on Capital – 3%
Growth Rate) if requested. However ask him the effect on NPV of a higher vs. lower discount rate,
to gauge his understanding of the concept. Answer: Higher discount rate means lower valuation.

Analysis

NPV analysis: Based on the information from Exhibit A, the net present value of the target company
is = $90M / (10%) = $900 million (assume perpetuity), which is less than the
purchase price tag of $950 million.
Industry Attractiveness: not particularly attractive, unless the larger competitor can use economies of
scale and dominant position for economic gain.

Exhibit 1
Purchase Price $950 M
Annual operating income before tax $90 M
Cash $30 M
No. of employees 2000
Return of capital 12%
Market risk premium 7%
Growth rate 3%
Tax rate 40%","Performance
Evaluation

Expected: Candidate identifies that the purchase price is higher than the NPV. Recommendation
wrap-up should clearly include a ―go / no go‖ decision followed by quantitative (valuation) and
qualitative (industry and compatibility analysis) facts..
Good: A strong candidate will recognize that this case deals with internal factors (synergies and
economies of scale) as well as some external factors (opportunity costs and industry attractiveness).
Excellent: An excellent candidate will include some of the following additional insights.
A more comprehensive NPV would include the new cash flow from synergies, as well as
the previously calculated NPV. Therefore the $900 million + [Synergies 30M/(12%-3%) =
333M] = $1,233M value of target > 950 price tag.
In addition to the cash flows expected from synergies, the potential economies of scale and tax
advantages from funding the acquisition with debt could be seen as other sources of revenue.
These considerations further improve the deal.
 Competitive and regulatory responses to block the merger are reasonable to assume due to
concerns over industry concentration.
 Benchmarking the value of the POA acquisition to other similar M&A in the industry.
 Consider what multiple of operating profits other acquisitions been valued at?

Purchase Price $950 M
Annual operating income before tax $90 M
Cash $30 M
No. of employees 2000

Prompt

You have been hired by the internal strategy group at Yahoo. You are asked to analyze the recent
acquisition of YouTube, an online video community, by Google for $1.6 billion. Is this move a
competitive threat for Yahoo?

Guidance

This is a valuation case and involves assessing the potential threat of competition‘s merger to the
business. The case is primarily qualitative in nature and tests the candidate‘s conceptual
understanding of M&A activity and overall business knowledge/judgment. The case offers the
candidate several opportunities to be creative in problem-solving. A quality candidate will imbue the
discussion with structure, creative solutions, and demonstrate knowledge of current business
landscape.
Core Competencies and Overall Situation Analysis - The candidate should think about the
acquisition against the backdrop of the core competencies that each firm brings to the table. There
are no absolute right/wrong answers; one approach is outlined below.

Analysis

Yahoo has positioned itself as a destination site. It wants consumers to go to Yahoo! and explore all
of its wonderful services, spending time and money there. Time means that advertisers‘ ads are
more likely to be clicked. Money means that Yahoo! is making ecommerce transactions, or selling
subscriptions to premium online services. It tries to promote a sense of community among its users.
Google has spent its early years as a search engine. To  ̳google‘ has become synonymous with
search. To take advantage of this brand-name recognition, Google pioneered advances in adbased
software that allowed businesses to better target consumers segments based on the particulars of
the search. Google has the ―eyeballs‖ of the consumers, but it doesn‘t have the consumers‘ wallet. It
wants to monetize all this traffic.
The acquisition of YouTube by Google is a competitive threat. You Tube is a move toward creating a
community. The company spent $1.6 billion because it believes it will be able to monetize this traffic
somehow.

Prompt –
part II

Competitive Response – Inform the candidate that Yahoo wishes to counter this threat and
assume that feasibility and cost are not a concern at this point. Ask the candidate to develop a
competitive response and give candidate creative license. There are no absolute right/wrong
answers; some ideas are outlined below.

Guidance The candidate should ask for a moment to collect his/her thoughts, and ideate creative solutions

Analysis

Suggested Answers:
 Create an offering to counter YouTube for the Yahoo community
 Buy Google
 Find a way to share real-time videos among friends from mobile devices or wristwatches. This
would involve a cross-selling strategy with a partner
 Create backdrops (or allow open source coders to create them) from historical events or sporting
arenas or famous movies, and enable people to be able to re-enact scenes or create new ones
(An example of this might be a rock stadium backdrop and you and your friends can jam on
instruments and make a rock video)

Prompt –
part III

Provide candidate the hypothetical situation in which Google decides to proceed with the YouTube
acquisition and believes that it can charge $150 per user annually and make 67% margins. Ask the
candidate to determine if Google can break-even with its current user base?

Guidance

Information to be given if asked:
• User base: 40 million
• Discount rates should be ignored
• Assume no user base growth or attrition.

Analysis

Acquisition Cost = $1.6bn
Therefore, Margin/user needed to recover acquisition cost = $40
Actual Margin/user = $100 per year
Therefore, Google will break-even.","Performance

Current: Client has 40% of the market, competitor #1 has 30% competitor #2 has 15%, with the
remaining 15% belonging to many small manufacturers.
Trends: Five years ago, your client had 60% of the market, competitor #1 had 15%, and competitor
#2 had 10%. Your client has lost significant market share to its two main competitors over the last
few years.
Customers - All three competitors sell to the same customers.
Price
Client's product is priced higher than others. This has always been the case.
Differences that allow for a premium price: Client has a strong reputation/image of quality in the
market and the market has always been willing to pay a premium for that reputation because it
implied a longer lasting more reliable product. This is critical for some farmers because they cannot
afford to have a piece of equipment break down.
Features
The products all have the same basic features. However, tractors are not commodity items and a
few differences do exist.

Analysis

(PQ – (FC + VC*Q))
Revenue insight: Quantity decrease driven by market share loss has driven revenues down
Costs insight: VC increases are driving unprofitability. The specific VC driving this is finished part
prices. The client assumed customers would pay more for better products, but they are not.

Guidance

Candidate should explore reasoning for profitability decline by asking the following questions:
Change in sales revenues: Revenues are down.
Change in sales quantities: Quantity is down.
Change in price: Prices are up.
Change in costs: Costs are up
Change in fixed costs: Unchanged.
Change in variable costs: Variable costs have increased tremendously. The client does not know
why material prices have gone up so staggeringly.
Candidate should deep dive on variable cost breakdown by identifying potential buckets
Type of operation (manufacturing or assembly-only): Primarily assembly.
Change in finished part prices: Finished part prices have gone up.
Change in raw material prices for suppliers: Not to client's knowledge.
Change in supplier labor costs: No change. Also, no change in suppliers.
Candidate should then probe on why finished part prices have gone up.
Reason for suppliers charging higher prices for the same products: They're not--the prices have
increased as a result of product improvement efforts. Client has tightened tolerances and improved
the durability of component parts.
Reason for product improvements: Client strives to sell the world‘s best tractors.
Customer willingness to pay for product improvements: Client assumed yes.

Analysis

Prices have been raised to cover the costs of improvements, but customers do not place a high
value on the improvements, so the price increase has resulted in a drop in sales. The client needs to
incorporate a cost/benefit analysis procedure into its product improvement process. The client
should also evaluate their marketing plans to ensure their customers are aware of product
improvements and understand their value. Before scaling back their product improvement process,
the client needs to evaluate competitor's R&D and product improvement positions.","Performance
Evaluation

Expected:
- Profitability framework
- Market share probing
Good:
- Identify need to understand profitability decline in terms of changes in revenue and cost levers
- Key in on variable cost increases and identify key buckets that go into building a tractor
Excellent:
- Asking probing questions on why part prices have increased and if these increases have been
passed to the customer
- Making recommendations for cost repositioning and assessing market risks"
"Nabisco’s Market Share
Prompt

The salted food division at Nabisco has been steadily losing market share over the past two years,
from a high of 20% to the current level of 18%. Profits as a percentage of sales, however, have been
growing. What could be causing this?

Guidance

Here is some information that will help the candidate analyze the situation:
Market Size or Company Sales: Show Exhibits 1&2
Main Competitors: Largest competitors are two multinational consumer products companies that feature
complete lines of snack foods. Together, the two companies have about 50% of the market share.
Differentiation from competitors: Nabisco’s sales reps are regarded as the best in the industry.
Change in client’s product line: None
Change in client’s costs over the period, as % of selling price: Show Exhibit 3.
Exhibit 3 may generate questions about promotion, sales force reductions, sales channels, reasons for
changing the marketing budget, etc. when asked, provide the following information about sales channels,
sales force, promotions, etc.
Reason for sales cut: Sales force cut to reduce costs, but number of outlets unchanged
Cause of change in the marketing budget: The changes come from reduced trade promotions
Sales channels: Products primarily sold in large grocery store chains and convenience stores
Sales force/customer interaction: Sales force visits each customer at least once per quarter.
Timing of promotions: Promotions usually occur at the end of each quarter.
Impact of promotions: Promotions required for end of aisle displays and advertising space.

Analysis

Sample framework:
External Factors: A decrease in market share may suggest
Competitor dynamics:
Existing players have increased market share
New players have entered the market
Market dynamics:
Market is growing
Client is unable to capture the growth. Why?

Internal Factors
Market share loss may suggest that the company is not spending enough on promotions
Growing profits may suggest that the company is reducing cost
Potential Conclusion
The data show a large decrease in sales force and marketing expenditure. Most of the marketing
reduction was in trade promotions. Product is sold through grocery chains and convenience stores,
which are traditionally driven by periodic trade promotions. The reduction in trade promotions
brought about a loss of shelf space, which led to a decrease in market share. Also, the product line
did not change in a product category where new products and line extensions are routine. The
market has been growing, indicating a missed opportunity for new products in the market. Lastly,
profitability increased due to lower costs, but it may not be sustainable.","Performance
Evaluation

Expected: The candidate will put together a framework and walk the interviewer through his thought

Excellent: The candidate will synthesize the information provided and present a clear and concise
summary to CEO John Keebler on how and why the sales channel/sales force/promotions have
impacted Nabisco‘s market share."
"Sgt. Slaughter
Prompt

Sergeant Slaughter‘s Construction Company is a leading provider of construction and infrastructure
materials. It has two divisions: Oil & Gas and Government. The government division‘s main
customer is the US Military. Your client is offering construction services to help the US military to
build bases. Construction includes dining facilities, dorms, and infrastructure projects for troops
around the world. Each division has its own procurement department. The procurement for the
government division spends $6 billion on the items they purchase. They resell those items for a
profit to the Government. The Vice President of procurement for the government division called
your consulting firm to advise them on how to spend less money on the purchased items and
operate more efficiently.

Guidance

The candidate should take some time (~1 min) to draw a framework and walk through the
framework for the interviewer. Sgt. Slaughter‘s Construction Company needs to make its
procurement more efficient and determine how to reduce procurement costs. Address the problem
as an operations/value chain problem and try to identify the links and levers that could influence the
efficiency. The candidate should generate themes within the company to potentially explore. Here
are four killer ideas.
1. The contractual relationship with the suppliers and the government.
2. The efficiency of the workers
3. The synergies within the company – the collaboration with the Oil & Gas division
4. The efficiency of the information flow - technology

Prompt –
Part II

First we need to understand the nature of the business relationship between the suppliers and the
Government. What information do we need to accomplish this?

Guidance

Possible questions and analysis:
 What kind of contracts do they have, long-term or short-term?
 What are the advantages/disadvantages of being in long-term contracts or short-term?
 How constant is the demand? Does the government always spend $6 billion on this contract or is
it expected to grow or decline?
 How many suppliers? Is there volatility in the demand or supply?
 What is Sergeant‘s competitive advantage? Is there competition for the contract?
Give the candidate the relevant information below.
Contracts between suppliers and the Government division are short-term in nature.
The company has only one supplier. The supplier offers the best cost/quality ratio and Sgt.
Slaughter would like to keep it, if possible. The client is not the only customer for the supplier but is
one of the largest. The company is the main supplier for the Government. They are the best at what
they do. They do not need to worry about the competition as long as they maintain the present
prices and quality.
Note: The interviewee should ask about the volatility of demand and infer that a long-term contract
with the supplier will be less beneficial if Government spending on military bases is volatile (for
example, if the Iraq war ends tomorrow, demand will drop). Also, a single supplier could be grounds
for diversification to improve negotiating power.

Analysis

See what ideas the candidate can generate. Remember that Sergeant Slaughter cannot negotiate a
better price from Uncle Sam. The proposed solutions should not dwell on competitive issues.
Possible proposals:
• Try to identify multiple suppliers or negotiate a better deal with the current one using this
possibility as bargaining power.
• Create long-term contracts that should offer better pricing, but negotiate a ―call clause‖ if the
Government drops the demand.
• Try to identify synergies with the Oil & Gas division

Prompt –
Part III

What organizational questions should we ask about the people?

Guidance

Possible questions and analysis:
• Are the people that deal with the suppliers experienced enough?
• Are there incentives in place? What can be changed?
• Is their staffing model efficient? Do they work enough? Are they efficient? What is their level of
productivity?
• Can/should we lay off workers?
• Do they have enough training?
Here is some information to relay to the candidate. Consider it to be like a data dump—see how
well the candidate can drink from the fire hose.
The staff is not necessarily the most experienced in the field. They are not very good at negotiating
with the supplier, due primarily to lack of experience. The VP of Procurement is actually a newly
hired, former lawyer. The workers do not focus on negotiating with the supplier, as they spend most
of the work on troubleshooting the contracts and enforcing them (have the items delivered on time,
ordering the supplies ahead of time, forecasting demand etc). The productivity of the workers is an
issue. They have a target of 88% productivity time for the workers (88% of the time they are paid,
they should work productively for the company) but the workers are productive only 80% of their
time billed. There are no training and learning processes in place for the workforce. Also, the bonus
structure is fixed. They receive a 10% undifferentiated bonus at the end of the year if the company
makes a profit.

Analysis

See what ideas the candidate can generate.
Possible proposals:
1. Try to hire more experienced workers
2. Offer training
3. Add incentives - bonuses connected to the money they save from the supplier
4. Reduce the workforce; put a productivity check in place to raise it to the 88% mark.
5. Have the Procurement manager get an MBA!

Prompt –
Part IV

Let‘s address bargaining power and find synergies with the Oil & Gas division. What can we ask
Sergeant Slaughter?

Guidance

Possible questions and analysis:
• Do they have the same supplier?
• How much is the Oil & Gas ordering comparing with the $6 billion for Government?
• Are the divisions interacting?
• Do they collaborate to have a stronger bargaining power?
• Do they share information and data about their supplier‘s contracts and demand forecast?
• Can they combine the procurement departments for the two divisions and have one larger for the
entire company?
Here is some background information for the candidate:
The Government division does not communicate efficiently with the Oil & Gas division. They use the
same supplier but they have issues integrating data therefore one of the recommendations should
address technology and information sharing issues. They do not have a common database with
prices across the globe and former experiences. The Oil & Gas division accounts for $2 billion in
orders from suppliers.

Analysis

Possible proposals:
1. Coordinate better with the Oil & Gas division and try to integrate orders to obtain stronger
bargaining power over the supplier
2. Try to institute a common system to communicate future orders/demand and try to negotiate
them together
3. Build a database accessible to both divisions with prices negotiated with multiple suppliers in
time to have a common negotiating basis
4. Organize meetings with the procurement teams of both divisions to share best practices and
negotiating tips
5. Unite the two procurement departments into one larger, company-wide solution

Prompt –
Part V

The VP calls you for an update. Please inform him of your findings.

Guidance

The student should wrap up the case in 3-4 sentences (30-60 sec) such as:
1. State a position
2. Give evidence based on case
3. Other considerations and/or creative aspects
To reduce cost, the VP could combine the two divisions from a technology, procurement, and
workforce perspective. Additionally, the productivity of the workers needs to be increased through
training and new hires. Last, the company should try to negotiate long-term contracts with the
government and aim to obtain lower prices from suppliers.

","Performance
Evaluation

Expected:
 Interviewee takes subtle cues from interviewer to move on to next topic
 Ability to generate at least several solutions
Good:
 Creativity in generating solutions (and many of them)
 Listing solutions in a final ―Recommendations‖ slide used to conclude case
Excellent:
 Carries the discussion well. This is not a case where the interviewee leads. Instead, the
interviewee should make sure the case is conversational - just the right amount of back and forth
and no awkward pauses."
"Bank Commissions

Prompt

Your client is a regional commercial bank and your task is to make a recommendation to improve
the profitability of the retail segment of their business operations. Specifically you are required to
evaluate the merits of a proposal made by the CFO - a commission-based incentive program
targeted at the bank‘s tellers with the objective of increasing product sales. How much commission
should the bank pay its tellers per unit of product sold?

Guidance

This information should only be given if asked (or if the candidate is struggling).
Product Mix: The bank has four products it wants to sell in this program - CDs, Checking accounts,
Mutual funds, and IRAs.
[The Interviewee should ask for more information about the products, without which we cannot
ascertain the profitability of each product in the mix.]
Revenue Streams: If the interviewee asks for the bank‘s sources of revenue for the products, first
ask the interviewee to list what he/she thinks are the specific sources of revenue for the bank‘s four
products. The answers are not important to the case. However, it will 1) illustrate the interviewee‘s
creativity and 2) check the candidate‘s poise.
Possible answers : Interest generated, commission earned, perhaps an overnight float option,
synergies or
economies of scale from cross selling.
Profit Margins: The interviewee should ask for the profit margin on each of these products in order
to estimate a commission structure. Information to be given if asked:
The profitability is as follows:
 CD‘s: 2% with an average $4,000 initial deposit
 Checking: 4% with an average $2,000 initial deposit
 Mutual Funds: 1% with an average $8,000 initial deposit
 IRA‘s: 2% with an average $4,000 initial deposit.

Guidance

Incentive Program Options – The Interviewee should arrive at a profit margin of $80
per product and constrain his incentive program within this range. Explore at least four different
incentive options.
Answer: A fixed fee per product, a percentage of the profits, a fixed fee for a certain number of
products sold that would decline after a threshold, or a variable commission depending based on
products and spreads.

Analysis

Criteria for selection of incentive program - Ask the Interviewee what information he would need
to determine the best incentive program for the bank .
Answer:
Profitability - The ease of sale, whether all tellers are equally effective sellers, profit per teller or
per customer, estimated commission as a percentage of current salary, cost of incentive program
Human Capital – The program that best motivates employees to sell products and increases
retention rate.
Tell the interviewee that his/her choices can be narrowed down to one. In this case, the assumption
is that all the tellers are equally effective and that all the products can be sold with roughly the
same effort. So what would you base the commission on then? Why?
Answer: Fixed fee option as it is a straightforward incentive and has a large upside for employees.
Also administration costs are relatively less.
[Note: It is possible that the interviewee comes up with an even better answer than this. If that is the
case, acknowledge the answer and tell them the client would like to proceed with the fixed fee
option]

Analysis

Cost of incentive program - Steer the Interviewee toward discussing the cost structure of the fixed
fee incentive program. The Interviewee should ask about the present salaries of the tellers and the
expected sales/teller.
Information to be given if asked:
 Average Salary per year per teller: $25,000
 Expected sales/teller: five products per week.
Thus: Annual sales/teller = 250 products (5 products per week * 50 weeks per year)
 Commission Fee = $10
 New profit margin = ($80-$10) = $70
Ask the interviewee to wrap up. ―I have a meeting with the CFO in 5 minutes. Tell me your final
recommendation.‖","Performance
Evaluation

Expected:
 You understood the interviewee‘s framework / plan to solve the case
 Referred to framework often to ask questions
 Asked for help when lost.
 Calm and collected
Good:
 Made a final recommendation and included data.
 Integrated data well and reached insights by seeing the big picture
 Drove the case
Excellent:
 An excellent candidate will do all the above and will mention risks or practical implications of
recommendation:
 Tracking field in their accounting system to associate correct teller ID with sales made
 Changes in payroll systems
 Sales training program for tellers
 Effectiveness study to measure impact on employee retention/satisfaction"
"Euro Seafood
Prompt

One of our private equity clients recently acquired a leading European seafood restaurant chain.
The chain owns and operations 700 restaurants across Europe. Same store sales (SSS) declined
last year. The private equity parent has aggressive expectations for improved business
performance. How can the client improve SSS?

Guidance

When the candidate asks about SSS and the main driver of that, please hand them exhibit 1. The
main takeaway here should be that customer traffic is highly correlated with SSS growth.
When the candidate asks for competitor information, please hand them exhibit 2. The main
takeaway here should be that there is limited opportunity to increase price or bill size.
When the candidate asks about the current table configurations, please hand them exhibit 3. The
main takeaway here should be that there is opportunity to reconfigure the restaurants to
accommodate more parties of one or two.

Analysis

The data shows that 4-seater tables are ~50% utilized during peak hours [Look at the chart. It is
hard to read on purpose. About 1⁄4 of the 4-seat tables are occupied by 3 people. About 3⁄4‘s of the
4-seat tables are occupied by 3 people. Thus, 1⁄4(75% occupancy)+ 3⁄4 (50% occupancy) = ~50%
utilization]; there are on average 2 people sitting at a 4-seater (4-seat capacity*50% utilization).
Lets assume we reconfigure each restaurant so that one 4-seater is separated into two 2-seaters,
effectively adding 2 seats. When the candidate suggests this, prompt him/her by asking ―What
is the bottom line impact of adding 2 seats per restaurant?
Additional Seats: 2
Peak Hours: 2 (let the candidate make this assumption)
Table turns per hour: 2 (let the candidate make this assumption)
Additional meals per restaurant= 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 meals
8 meals/restaurant x 700 restaurants (give this number when requested) = 5,600 meals total
5,600 meals x $50/average meal (give this number when requested) = $280,000 revenue
$280,000 revenue x 30% margin (give this number when requested) = $84,000 additional profit/day
$84,000/day x 360 days/year (let candidate make this assumption) = ~$30 M additional profit/year

Analysis

Synthesis of the case facts:
Customer Traffic
 Traffic is the biggest contributor to SSS growth
Client should focus on initiatives that add the most value with minimal investment
Improved seat utilization could deliver an extra $30M annually in profits
Number of items
Average check size and margins are higher than competition
Price per menu item
Client already priced at a premium over competitors

"Smith Financial CRM
Prompt

A major U.S. financial services company has just implemented a Client Relationship Management
(CRM) system. The goal: To give leadership a real time view into the organization‘s sales channel.
For years, sales teams have maintained client sales information in separate excel spreadsheets.
This prevented leadership from having visibility into and a holistic view of sales opportunities,
which meant sending multiple requests to sales teams for the latest and greatest information.
By the end of fiscal year, all sales teams are expected to migrate their sales data onto this new
system, and use it to manage all sales information.
You are the change management lead for this project. How would you get everyone on the
system? Who are the various stakeholders? How would you communicate to these stakeholders?
Note about nature of the Case: This is a Human Capital Case and thus contains an approach much
different from the usual ―Strategy‖ case. However the candidate should not abandon the use of a
framework. Here the focus isn‘t so much on the bottom line as it is on the approach needed to
manage the proposed changes in the organization. The case should be carried out in a
conversational format with hints and clues to push the candidate alongside the case prompt.

Guidance

Here are some guiding questions that will help the candidate analyze the situation:
1) Who will be affected by this change?
2) What are some ways that you can think of to best announce/communicate this change? Is it a
single person‘s role, or should multiple individuals of different capacities be involved?
3) Do you think everyone will be happy with this change? How will you handle dissention?

Analysis

 Definition of Stakeholders: Leadership, Sales teams, & the rest of the organization
 Find out how people in organization like to receive communications
 Identify a change champion (leads one-on-one sessions)
 Technical support/training: how to contact the help desk
 Create a central place for feedback/comments
 Create honest communications (share both the bad and the good)
 Generate excitement/ engagement through a fun and well- branded communications campaign (all
communications/ marketing should use this brand/identity)
 CEO Webcast (announcing the change initiative)

Prompt—
Part II

Do you see any other change issues? How would you address them?

Guidance

Here are some guiding questions that will help the candidate analyze the situation:
1) How do you think on-boarding will work? Will people automatically know how to use the system?
2) How will we keep people using this new system? What is the benefit to them? (if candidate
struggles, mention the word  ̳incentivize‘ or  ̳benefit‘)
3) How do we know we made the right decision in making these changes?

Analysis

 Training (web based and classroom based) for sales team and technical support
 Design and implement incentives/ tie to Performance Management
 Create success metrics

Prompt—
Part III

How do you measure success? What do you do if leadership digs in their heels and resists the
change?
(After the candidate answers that question, please follow-up with the following question and change
the direction of the case)
Now, let‘s change things up. Say the system was implemented - without the help of change
management - and it failed (i.e., the people have not adopted the new technology). The team
brings you on to salvage the project. What would you do?

Guidance

1) When/how will you set goals for the outcome of this project?
2) How would you respond if senior management calls you into a meeting to tell you that they refuse
to use this new system?

Analysis

 Set measurable goals at the onset of the project: ex. 75% usage by the end of the project,
reduce number of manual excel reports by 50% within the first 3mo of the CRM launch
 Share with management the other projects that can now be tackled to improve company
performance, now that less time is being spent on maintaining excel spreadsheets.","Performance
Evaluation

Ask the candidate to synthesize all information analyzed in case

Good: The candidate will touch on the major points mentioned.
Excellent: The candidate will acknowledge and preemptively address and lay out a contingency
plan in the event that the CRM rollout does not go as planned."
"F2D Electronics
Prompt

Problem Definition: Your client is the nation‘s largest distributor of electrical and communications
products. The 150-year old company distributes more than one and a half-million products (1.5
million SKUs) made by multiple manufacturer/suppliers through 256 branches and warehouses in
the US. Given that they are the middle-men, margins in the distribution industry are very thin. F2D
has been generally decentralized with a high degree of branch autonomy (branch and district

managers are kings of their own domain). Each branch has its own processes with considerable off-
system accounting and record keeping on Excel spreadsheets, etc. Given growth over the last

decade, the home-grown mainframe computer system can no longer effectively handle the volume
of transactions. In addition, the time required to reconcile and report sales, inventory, and financial
information from the branches to corporate is hindering senior management‘s ability to make timely
business decisions. To address these issues, the client is undertaking a major business
transformation program. They will reengineer most business processes (sales, marketing,
forecasting, logistics, finance, customer service) and are implementing one system for everyone in
the company that will provide real-time information and a 360 degree view of the business. Senior
management anticipates a high degree of resistance from the branches. Branch leadership feels the
system and processes from corporate will not understand their needs and threatens their autonomy.
Past initiatives have struggled because people were not adequately prepared for the changes.
Employees are worried about how their jobs will change and whether they will have the skills to do
their jobs within the new system.
Question: How would you assist the client to successfully manage this large scale change
program?
Note about nature of the Case: This is a Human Capital Case and thus contains an approach much
different from the usual ―Strategy‖ case. However the candidate should not abandon the use of a
framework. Here the focus isn‘t so much on the bottom line as it is on the approach needed to
manage the proposed changes in the organization. The case should be carried out in a
conversational format with hints and clues to push the candidate alongside the case prompt.
Guidance Note: Remember that this case is intended to be carried out in a conversational manner.

Analysis

 Leadership Alignment and Visibility/Sponsorship: Facilitate leadership at corporate to ―sing from
the same page.‖ Then, enable corporate leadership to engage district and branch leaders. Clearly
explain why the changes are required in the competitive business environment, why their leadership
is needed and how they will be rewarded. In times of large scale changes, there should be a high
degree of leadership visibility.
 Buy-In: Employees need to know that their leaders (at corporate and branches) are behind this
effort and they need to hear this directly from their leaders. Provide talking points and support to
make it easier for them to communicate to employees.
 Communications: Develop a comprehensive communication strategy for internal and external
audiences. Explain to employees the business case for change, ―what is in it for them,‖ and how
their jobs will change. Communications should be timely and consistent to stem rumors. Similarly,
there should be a communications strategy for suppliers and customers to explain how service will
improve to assure them there will be no disruptions.
 Workforce engagement: Engage employees from as many branches as possible in the design and
implementation of the new process and system. Gather input on their business requirements
throughout the lifecycle of the project. Conduct roadshows out to the branches. Use trainers from
each of the branches to train end users. Engage branches and employees so they take ownership of
the system.
 Organizational Reinforcement/Incentives: Make sure those who are providing input, championing
and adopting the system are recognized, rewarded, and utilized as change agents.
 Training: Profile how jobs will change and train employees thoroughly on the new process and
system. Hands-on training close to the launch and relevant to employees‘ jobs tends to be most
effective.","Performance

"Professional Car Racing
Prompt

Your client is the owner of UPS #88, a racecar on the NASCAR tour. It races in the Nextel Cup, a
points-based championship where the season winner has accumulated the most points over the
course of the racing season.
There are 36 races in total, running from February to November. Dale Jarrett, a well-known celebrity
driver, races for the team. Dale helped win the Nextel Cup three years ago, and so far this year is
eighth in a field of 43 drivers.
A close friend who is the VP of marketing at Home Depot recently contacted the client. She inquired
about sponsoring a second racing team with the client. She recognizes that NASCAR is the fastest
growing segment among males ages 18-45. She also has talked to a successful driver from a
regional drag racing circuit to try out as the driver of the team.
Evaluate the potential of this opportunity.

Guidance

The candidate should present an overview of his/her approach to the case and develop a
framework. A profitability analysis should follow, with the candidate requesting revenue and cost
information. Interviewer should probe candidate on the sources of revenue in this market before
providing the following information.
Revenue information: included in Exhibit 1; before giving to candidate, ask what revenue buckets
they can think of, then give remaining
Cost information: included in Exhibit 2; before giving to candidate, ask what cost buckets they can
think of, then give remaining

Analysis

Revenue – Give candidate Exhibit 1 after buckets are outlined
$50K-1000K per race winnings. Assume average of 200K (other assumptions are ok)
36 races per year. Assume driver qualifies for 30.
$200K*30 = 6000K or 6M
Race winnings are 25% of total revenue
6M / .25 = 24M total revenue
Cost - Give candidate Exhibit 2 after buckets are outlined
Tell candidate that total costs are $20M
Profit
24M – 20M = 4M profit

Guidance

Since total revenue is not given, the candidate should recognize that the only way to calculate it
from the revenue information given is by estimating total race winnings and extrapolating based on
the percentage of total that these represent.
After being told the total costs, the candidate should revisit the revenue estimation and adjust the
average winnings assumption, if necessary (e.g. 100K avg would be unrealistic loss, while 500K
average would be unrealistic profit)

Analysis

Marginal cost of adding a new team
Total Costs = $20M
Race-facing costs = 40% / 2 * 20M = $4M
Equipment costs = 25% * 20M = $5M
Travel costs = 5% * 20M = $1M
Marginal costs of adding new team = 4+5+1 = $10M

Guidance

The candidate should now turn his/her attention to the cost of adding a new team. If interviewer
observes that the candidate needs direction, prompt him/her by asking: ―What is the minimum
amount of money that the client should ask for from Home Depot?‖
Information to be given with respect to adding a new team.
The costs affected w.r.t. addition of a new team are Salaries, Equipment, and Travel. The other two
cost components are associated with the engine shop.
Specifically,
 Race-Facing costs will double
 Equipment costs will double
 Travel costs will double

Prompt –
Part II

Should the client charge a premium to Home Depot for sponsorship?

Analysis

Option 1: Yes, we should charge a premium — Home Depot seems to have already made some
commitment to the deal by conducting initial negotiations with the potential driver. Therefore client
has bargaining power. Premium can be justified by providing Home Depot with an acceptable Return
on Investment analysis.
Option 2: No, we should not charge a premium —Home Depot has several other options to sponsor,
including 1) another race team, 2) another sport (e.g., baseball), 3) another racing circuit (e.g.,
Formula One)

Guidance

Potential for charging premium – The interviewer should ask candidate to evaluate the possibility of
charging a premium to Home Depot for the sponsorship. Note that there is no
right/wrong answer here; rather interviewer should evaluate response basis candidates‘ rationale.
Multiple answers are acceptable here. This answer key is not exhaustive.
After this question, ask candidate to wrap up case.

Evaluation

Expected:
- Accurate arithmetic
- Profitability framework
Good:
- Identify need to calculate marginal cost of new team
Excellent:
- Candidate discusses risks of adding new team. For example,
Other potential points include the natural tension between adding a new team and the allocation
of resources (e.g., high quality mechanics from Dale‘s team may work with the Home Depot car,
thus diluting the quality of performance of Dale).
Potential risks certainly include adding a new driver who has only drag racing experience. This
driver would probably not contribute to merchandising revenue, due to his relative anonymity.
-Candidate discusses validity of cost assumptions for new team. For example,
There is some validity, however, to the point that salaries for the new team may be lower because
the new driver lacks the name recognition of Dale Jarrett.
The total cost of equipment may be lower than average due to the ability to leverage the engine
shop technology. Some candidates might recommend closing the engine shop, but we have no
margin information to substantiate this."
"Lizette’s Luxury Properties
Prompt

Your client is a real estate developer, Lizette‘s Luxury Properties, and is currently assessing a new
project idea in Costa Rica. Costa Rica has a beautiful coastline which has historically been difficult
to access. The nearest airport was over six hours away. As of last year, a new airport was
constructed only a half hour away. There has been an investment boom in the region due to the
increasing number of tourists (popular with Americans and Asians). The Mandarin Oriental and The
Four Seasons, two prominent luxury hotel chains, were the first to enter this market with a 250-room
hotel each. Should your client invest in the tourism opportunity created by the new airport? Would
you recommend that s/he enter the market?

Guidance

The framework developed by the candidate may explore a variety of issues including: Core
Competencies, Market Attractiveness, ROI, and Project Success Factors. Here is some information
that will help the candidate analyze the situation:
Client‘s Core Competencies:
- The client has focused on hi-rise apartments (50%) and luxury condominiums (50%) in the past but
wants to enter the hotel arena.
- They have focused on world-class beaches, such as Playa del Carmen, Marbella, Coral Beach,
Tahiti, Fiji, Maldives, Mikonos, etc.
*The key insight here is that the client has past experience in construction of a similar type, but has
no direct experience in the hotel industry or service operations. Additionally, the client probably has
good judgment in spotting travel locations and has a successful track record with the construction of
prime properties.

Guidance

Market Attractiveness / Five Forces Analysis
 Market size - 875,000 tourists per year (assume 350 days in a calendar year)
 Average duration of stay per tourist - 4 nights
 Average hotel check - $2,000.
 Others - In terms of tourists, you depend on government spend on advertising, on travel agents,
and on the network effect of the existing hotels in the area.
 Competitiveness - Other hotels chains that are thinking of entering the market are Starwood,
Peninsula, and Imperial Hotels.
 Supplier Power - The local labor market offers a huge supplier of workers (very positive)
 Substitutes - You are fighting with every other ―paradise-type‖ destination, from Disneyland to
Vegas to Bermuda. Interest in this area, however, is sky high.
 Barriers to Entry - Government regulations, high capital requirements, unavailable beachfront
property.
 Buyer Power – The recent consolidation among travel agencies and proliferation of e-vendors put
buyers in a powerful position.

Analysis

Quantitative takeaway:
3.5 million tourist nights / 350 days = 10,000 tourists / night
$2,000 average check/ 4 days average stay = $500/night
Qualitative takeaway: Despite the competitive nature of the market it is large enough to be
profitable, and client has desired capabilities to successfully compete. The level of resources
required would be a barrier to entry and maybe there are others that need to be investigated--such
as government permits, access to sewage, water, etc.

Guidance

ROI Analysis – If the candidate brings up ROI, tell them that client has already short listed three
available lots. Ask him/her to recommend one of the three such that Return on Investment is
maximized?

• Average occupancy 50%
• No. of operating days in a year: 350
• Operating expenses are 100% variable
• At ROI 10%, company target is to recover investments within one year

Analysis

ROI Analysis:
ROI = Profit/Investment.
Revenue = Revs per night * number of nights * number of rooms * nights per year * occupancy rate
Option 1: Lover‘s Lair
•Operating Profits: (((($450 revenue – 250 operating costs) * 500 rooms)* 350 nights/year) * 50%
occupancy rate) = $17.5 million operating profits/year (a)
• Initial Investment: 30,000 cost/room * 500 rooms + $2,000,000 land = $17 million (b)
• Net Profit: (a)-(b) = $500,000 (c)
• ROI: (c) / (b) = $500,000/17 million = 2.9%

Analysis

ROI Analysis (Continued):
Option 2: Paradise Lost
• Operating Profits: (((($400-200) * 1000) * 350) * 50%) = $35 million
• Initial Investment: 28,000 cost/room * 1000 rooms + $4 million land = $32 million
• ROI: $3,000,000 / $32 million = 9.4%
Option 3: Fookwah Heights
• Operating Profits: (((($350-150) * 1500) * 350) * 50%) = $52.5 million
• Initial Investment: $25,000 * 1,500 rooms + $6 million land = 43.5 million
• ROI: 9 million / 43.5 million = 20.7%

Guidance

Factors determining project feasibility – Ask the candidate to list factors to be
considered in determining the feasibility of the project

Analysis

Good Concerns:
Competition (what are they focusing on? will it flood the market?)
Strategy (Where will you compete--low cost, high service, best in class, packages?)
How should the developer finance the building? Since the hotel will bring jobs maybe the
government can help with some tax deductions, free services, etc...
Great Concerns:
•How can they leverage their experience, what values from their other business can they leverage?
•Would they manage the hotel or build it and then find an operating partner like Starwood or Hilton?
•What are the existing barriers to entry, how would you change them to insure a greater degree of
success?

Final Prompt

After the candidate offers his/her insights, tell him/her to focus on ROI first with the room prices
specified in table and then with the market room price ($500).
Finally: Ask the candidate to conclude the case with a ―go/no go‖ decision, supporting it with the
insights drawn through out the case. Probe into additional concerns the client needs to address.","Performance
Evaluation

Expected:
Candidate will develop a structured framework that touches on some if not all of the categories
described. Candidate will exhibit accurate arithmetic in ROI analysis.
Good:
The candidate will be able to provide the qualitative takeaways regarding market attractiveness
and/or core competencies.
Excellent:
In addition to the above, the candidate will also identify the key concerns regarding the project
feasibility and provide a go/no go decision with supporting evidence from insights drawn from the
case."
"Napoleon’s Pizza Pies
Prompt

Napoleon‘s Pizza Pies (―Pizza fit for an Emperor‖) has recently tried to establish the best home
pizza delivery business in Paris. Pizza Hut, however, has a virtual monopoly on the pizza home
delivery market. Napoleon‘s has asked your consulting firm to analyze the issues that will determine
the likelihood of successful entry in the Parisian pizza market.
What information would you need and how would you analyze the pizza delivery market?

Guidance

1) Candidate needs to estimate the size of the Parisian home pizza delivery market. If the
candidate asks for market information, introduce Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2.
2) Other information available upon request:
 Percentage of Pizza Hut‘s business that is delivery is ~50%
 Almost 90% of deliveries take place outside the city centre
 City centre Pizza Hut stores offer predominantly restaurant service
 The market for pizza is growing at 5% annually. The submarket for pizza delivery is growing
at 8%
3) Candidate should do a market sizing, market attractiveness and segmentation and then look at
the cost structure of the industry to find a potential competitive advantage.

Analysis

Overall Pizza Delivery Market:
50% of business is delivery X [$1.2M / ~90% market share] = $667k
Of that, city centre‘s delivery market is:
$667k X 10% of delivery business is done in city centre = $67k

Evaluation

Expected:
It is expected that all candidates will complete a market sizing with realistic assumptions and a basic
market and cost analysis (similar to what is provided above).
Good:
Good candidates will remember that Pizza Hut has a virtual monopoly position in home delivery but
that the market for the city centre seems underserved. A good candidate will also ask for and
identify the different growth rate of the delivery market versus the pizza market in general.
Excellent:
Excellent candidates will complete a market sizing and quickly move into a complete industry
analysis for market segmentation and cost structure understanding. The candidate will identify the
opportunity in the city centre market and identify the low barriers to entry for Pizza Hut in that
market. The candidate should also consider that the execution of the delivery service may have
more complexity within a market like city centre.

Performance
Evaluation

Expected:
Recognize the potential for a price war with Pizza Hut and explain implications
Good:
Good candidates will identify Pizza Hut‘s reaction as an over-reaction based on their position in the
market. The candidate should avoid the price war in his recommendations and potentially focus on
key products or sub-segments of the city centre segment.
Excellent:
Excellent candidates will identify the over-reaction and look for ways to take advantage of this
strategic mistake made by Pizza Hut. The candidate should probe about any substantial differences
between the quality and speed of delivery for Napoleon and look to exploit any of them. Ultimately,
the candidate should recommend that Napoleon continue to focus on the premium market and
continue to execute on points of differentiation like customer service."
"K. Grace Hospital Chain
Prompt

Your client is a large hospital chain, K. Grace. There have been proposed legislation changes to
Medicare that will affect your client. For example, some surgeries will no longer be reimbursable at
the same rate. As a result, this has caused the hospital to consider a strategy that would shift its
focus toward less profitable surgeries by using alternative therapies. However, the client is
concerned about the decreased revenue potential from this proposed shift in strategy.
Currently the client has a $4 billion top line. Surgeries represent half of this total. Half of the
hospitals in the chain perform all of these surgeries. For this case, let‘s say that all patients are on
Medicare (private insurance is not a factor). Should we close part of the chain? All of the chain?
None of the chain? What drivers will help us arrive at a close / no close decision?

Guidance

Allow the candidate some time (<1.5 min) to create a structured framework.
Some issues to discuss could be the profitability (revenues and costs) of the surgeries. Look for a
basic framework that includes a revenue breakdown into prices and quantities and a simple cost
structure with fixed and variable costs.
Next, ensure that the candidate is considering the percentage of surgeries that is actually impacted.
Prompt the candidate by asking: Maybe we should explore whether the hospital chain has any
capabilities in providing alternative therapies—could we make money there?
Let‘s see external things, too, like the ability to influence the regulatory environment, the needs and
preferences of our end users (would they pay out-of-pocket?).
Lastly, the candidate should not fail to address the strategies competitors are adopting.

Guidance

Steer the candidate toward profitability information. What does he/she want to know? Allow the
candidate to make assumptions regarding profitability (guide them if their assumptions are way off
base). This case is not about the specific numbers, rather the analysis conducted.

Analysis

Typical impacted hospital (annual):
Patients: 1,000
Price (revenue) per patient: $1,000
Cost per patient: $800
Fixed Cost of facility: $100,000
If the candidates numbers are very different, suggest they use the numbers provided above for
simplicity.
Simple breakeven calculations should be made—The hospital must serve at least 500 patients to
remain open. Each patient delivers a $200 contribution margin.

Prompt—
Part II

How many patients would you have to lose below breakeven (500) to close the hospital?

Guidance The candidate needs information on the cost of exiting the business. Let them ask for it. Once they

request the information, you can give them the following: The exit cost is $50,000.

Analysis

The profitability over time, discounted back to today, minus the PV of the exit costs, should equal
zero to breakeven: Q*$200 – $100,000 = -$50,000. Q = 25
Another way to look at this is the value of lost customers to the business over time, taken as a
perpetuity. Or, loss / hurdle rate = exit cost. Assume a discount rate of 10%.
Loss / .10 = 50,000. Loss = $5,000, which equals 25 patients that you would have to lose below
breakeven to close the hospital. 500 - 25 = 475 patients to remain open

Prompt—
Part III

If fixed costs change to $150,000, how many patients will you need to break even? How many
patients would you have to lose to close the hospital?

Analysis

$150,000 / $200 = 750 patients to stay open
Loss / .10 = $50,000. The loss of future value that one gives up by incurring the exit costs equals 25
patients. Below 725 patients, the facility should close.

The hospital does some research and finds that 3/8 of its surgeries will not be reimbursable. A
government report says it will save 6-9% by passing the new legislation. You know that someone
has botched the research. How is the information contradictory?

Guidance

The candidate should ask for the national market share of the company. Otherwise, the data above
is like comparing apples to oranges.
The market share for your client is 20%.
This means that, according to your client, 7.5% (.375 * .20 = .075) of the government savings will
come from its surgeries, which represent only 20% of the total national market.","Performance
Evaluation

Our client is a start-up with the ability to deliver broadband internet to commercial airlines. How
would you help them think about their offering?

Guidance

About the case: This is a market entry case where candidate are required to evaluate the feasibility
of a new product in conjunction with the airline industry. The candidate should use a comprehensive
framework, walk the interviewer through it and be prepared for analytical detours throughout the flow
of the case.
The calculations represented here are only one approach and interviewees may take other
approaches, depending on the assumptions made. The interviewer should be mindful of this and
allow for flexibility.
Industry & Market Size Discussion: The interviewee should have mentioned this as a major bucket
in his/her framework.
Use the information below to provide guidance as necessary.
Broadband for the airlines
There is general interest in broadband internet from the airline industry. The start up would have to
invest relatively little up front and would keep most of the revenues. They would charge the
customers on a per flight pricing model.
Size of the Market
Ask the candidate to estimate the market size and hand over Exhibit 1. Inform the candidate that
there are 3,000 planes. Full answer in chart below
Pricing
In order to finish the market size, the candidate should ask for the price per
flight. Hand out Exhibit 2 and ask candidate to set the price.

"DMB Satellite, Inc.
Prompt

Stefan Lessard, the CEO of a large conglomerate, finds a once-in-a-lifetime deal and buys a satellite
at a heavily discounted price. He can keep it or sell it today for a profit. What questions could you
ask to gain critical information?

Guidance

The candidate should take some time to think and then come up with some basic questions.
Candidates should recognize this case as a profitability / market extension case. The candidate
should request revenue and cost information and then calculate the profit for each situation. Later,
the candidate should consider market dynamics, and the risks associated with having a single
customer versus a diversified portfolio.
This information should be given if asked for:
- Cost of satellite acquisition: $10 million
- Market value of satellite today: $35 million
- Repair/maintenance cost: Negligible. The satellite is in good condition.
- Launch status of satellite: Satellite is still in the box and needs to be launched if the company
decides to keep it. DMB can use it for 3 years after which it becomes obsolete ($0 resale value and
non-functional).
- Costs associated with launch: Launch costs are $10 million for high orbit launch and $8 million for
low orbit launch.
- Low orbit satellites are used to transmit data between two points where the distance between
them is on the order of 3,000 to 5,000 miles (e.g. from one coast to another). These satellites are
primarily used by corporations to transmit data in batches. Low orbit signal is subject to high
interference, thus it is not used when continuous transmission quality is critical. (solution for
multiple clients option)
- High orbit satellites are primarily used for continuous transmission (i.e. in real time) where signal
quality is critical. Live global television broadcasting is the primary application. (solution for news,
broadcasters, etc. - single client option)

Guidance

- Life expectancy: 5 years (needs to be replaced in 5 years, as it becomes obsolete)
- Potential customers for satellite services: There are two customer segments based on use: data
transmission and voice/video transmission. Large corporations use satellites to batch transfer
information periodically during the day. The use is short and intermittent, allowing for multiple
clients. News broadcasters and telecommunications companies use the satellites for voice/ video
transmission. They require 24-hour, global coverage limiting the satellite to only one client.
Potential to lease satellite capacity: Leasing satellite capacity is a good option but not available in
this case

Prompt—
Part II

What is the best road to profits for DMB Satellite?

Guidance

The candidate should conduct a profitability analysis listing the 3 options. 1) Sell today for a $35M
profit, 2) Operate single satellite offering data transmission service to multiple clients, and 3)
Operate single satellite system to offer voice and video transmission.
Low Orbit Revenues
 Each Year 1 customer pays $50,000 per month
 Each Year 2 customer pays $30,000 per month
 Each Year 3 customer pays $20,000 per month
 There is some competition entering the market and you can assume that you will need to reduce
the prices for the multiple customer solution every year to attract incremental revenues. Prices
for the contract you sign in year 1, however, fall to new rates in year 2.
 80% of customers generated in a given year will remain the following year.
[Note: Data has been intentionally left out. The candidate should ask for the expected number of
customers in each of the 3 years (see solution in Analysis section)]

Guidance

High Orbit Revenues
The high orbit customer pays $2,500,000 per month
This is a specialized market, where we have found only one potential customer who is ready to sign
up
The candidate should continue with the profitability analysis and cash flow calculations comparing
the three options: sell now, low orbit, and high orbit. If the candidate asks, the discount rate is
negligible.

Summary of profitability calculations:
Option #1 - Sell today for a $35 million dollar pre-tax profit. Strong candidates will recognize that
the $10 million acquisition cost is a sunk cost.
Option #2* - Operate single satellite offering data transmission service to multiple clients:
$73,360,000 profit (pre-tax). One key trick is that in year one you‘ll have 50 clients, in year two
those 50 clients become 50*80% = 40 clients. In year three those 40 clients have been reduced
again to 40*80% = 32 clients.
Option #3* - Operate single satellite system to offer voice and video transmission. Requires
increased upfront investment: $85,000,000 profit (pre-tax).
* Very important: Candidate should remember to verify that company has access to capital for
purchase and launch.

Option 3 generates the highest profits. However, Option 3 has highest initial cost and offers strong
bargaining power for the single client. Also, what if we lose the client somehow to bankruptcy?
There are also few available customers. The risk is high.
Option 1 gives us a nice chunk of change. But, do we have other viable investment opportunities for
the cash generated in that sale? If the market value of the satellite is $45 million, it‘s doubtful we

"(Retailer)
Question
A major retailer of clothing and household products has been experiencing sluggish growth and less than expected profits in the last
few years. The CEO has hired you to help her increase the company's annual growth rate and ultimately its profitability.

• The retailer has 15 stores located in shopping malls in metropolitan and suburban areas.
• Total revenue from the 15 stores has declined, despite major back-end cost savings.","Recommended Solution

High Level Plan of Attack
• You need to understand why growth has slowed and profitability has declined despite cost savings.
• Do different stores experience variations in revenue? Do they all have the same approach to selling?
• Is purchasing behavior of the consumer different in the two areas?
• Has there been any new competition on the scene? In one area and not the other?
Lay Out Your Thoughts
• Use the profitability framework. The case tells you that cost savings have been achieved. Focus on the revenue side.
• Focus on the fact that the company has 15 different stores, in two different geographical areas. What are the key differences between the two in
terms of the consumer, competition, and growth?

Dig Deeper: Gather Facts
• Are some stores more profitable than others? Yes they are. We see variations throughout.
• Are there differences in profitability between the metropolitan and suburban stores? Yes there are. We see that the suburban stores are more
profitable than the urban ones.
• Is there more competition in the urban areas? No, not really. It's proportionally the same.
• Do the stores sell the same products? Yes they do. All stores have the same product mix.
o [Given that all stores sell the same product mix and some are more profitable than others, this should lead you to look at consumer
behavior]

• Do consumers in the suburban areas have different purchasing behavior than the urban dwellers? Yes, as a matter of fact, they do. The suburban
customer tends to buy more of the major appliances and electronic equipment than the urban consumer. The urban consumer buys mostly items
such as clothing, small furniture items, and small appliances.
o [You can make the assumption that suburban consumers have higher incomes and are in more need of major appliances given the
difference in living quarters between houses versus apartments in the city.]

• Is there a difference in profitability between the goods purchased by the suburban and urban consumers? Yes. Major appliances and TVs and
stereos are higher profit items than clothing and minor appliances.
• Would you say that the current product mix is more suited for the suburban customer than for the urban? Yes. I guess it is.

Key Findings
• The consumer in the city has different needs and purchasing behavior than the suburban consumer. The stores in the city are not catering to the
demographics of its surroundings.
• Unnecessary costs are being incurred through inventory and lost floor space in the city stores, resulting in lost revenue for the retailer.
Recommendations
• Further analyze the customer for each of the stores and differentiate purchasing behavior and income levels.
• Cater the product mix according to the customer research findings.
• Stores that cannot sustain selling low cost items should consider the possibility of closure."
"(Butcher Shop)
Question
A fast food chain recently bought a bovine meat-processing outlet to supply it with fresh hamburgers and other meets. The shop process is: cows enter
from one end of the shop, meat gets processed in the middle, and then the meat gets packaged and delivered at the other end.

Cows
Enter

Meat
Processed

Meat
Delivered

The manager of the butcher shop however could not decide whether to have the cows walk or run into the meat processing room. Can you help him?","Recommended Solution

High Level Plan of Attack
• The first thing you want to do is to understand how much meat can be processed (the capacity) when the cows walk versus run.
• Then analyze the cost implications of the cows walking versus running.
• Next, calculate the size of the market and demand for the product.
• Finally, match demand with supply.

Lay Out Your Thoughts
• This is a market sizing, operation’s cost analysis question. Try to lay your plan of attack on paper in a logical sequence of steps to take.

Dig Deeper: Gather Facts & Make Calculations
Shop Capacity
• Let’s assume that only fresh hamburger meat is processed at the shop. Let’s also assume that from each cow, you can make 20 hamburgers.
• How many hours per day is the shop open for? 10 hours, 5 days a week.
• Now, if the cows walk in, 10 cows can be processed in one hour, given current labor.
• This gives us an estimated 2000 hamburgers that can be processed in one day if the cows were to walk (20 hamburgers/cow x 10 cows/hour x 10
hours/day).
• If the cows were to run in, let's assume that 25 cows can be processed in one hour. This gives us 5000 hamburgers per day.

Costs
• Next, we must calculate the costs associated with the two different capacities. Let us assume that labor cost increases proportionally to the increase
in processed meats, and overhead increases, but not proportionally due to some sunk costs, for more equipment and other expenses. Here is the
breakdown:

Walk Run
Overhead $5000 $10,000
Labor 1,000 2,500
Total Cost 6,000 12,500
Burgers/Week 10,000 25,000
Cost per Burger $0.60 $0.50

• This shows that by running, costs drop by 10 cents
on each burger.
• To estimate revenue, we need to calculate the
demand from estimating what the market size
would be.

• Let's assume that the fast food chain has 10 outlets, and the meat-processing factory serves all 10. Each outlet serves a vicinity of about 30,000
people. Now, let's also assume that there are about 3 other competitors in each vicinity, leaving it with a market share of about 25% of the
customers in each area, for a total of 75,000 potential customers.
• Of those 75,000, about 40% of them fall within the demographic target, leaving 30,000 desired customer.
• Given the trends in healthy foods, out of the 30,000 desired customers, about a third will be allowed by their parents to frequent any one of the
establishment on a regular basis - leaving 10,000.
• Of the 10,000 customers, each will frequent the establishment about twice a week on average - 20,000 visits. Out of these visits, about half order a
burger over another item on the menu - for a total of 10,000 burgers a week.

Key Findings/Recommendations
• Even though it’s cheaper to produce more burgers, there’s no demand to support it.
• Have the cows walk. This meets demand and ensures fresh hamburgers."
"(Juice Producer)
Question
A major producer of juice is in the business of processing and packaging fruit juice for retail outlets. Traditionally, the producer has packaged the juice in
18-ounce carton containers. Recently, in response to demand from the market, the producer purchased a machine that packages the juice in plastic gallons
(36 ounces). Over the next couple of years, sales continued to grow on average of 20% per year. Yet, as sales continued to increase, profits steadily
decreased. The owner cannot understand why. He hires you to help out.","Recommended Solution
High Level Plan of Attack
• We know that sales have been increasing, so revenue is not an issue. The problem must be costs.
• Because of the change in packaging, the producer has incurred additional costs that are not accounted for, causing profits to decline.
Lay Out Your Thoughts
• Use the profitability framework. Gather information on the revenue side, but focus mostly on the cost side.

Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations
• Looking at the revenue side, how much did the producer charge for the 18 oz. carton? $2.00 per container.
• For the 36 oz. plastic gallons? For twice the size, the producer figured he would provide an incentive to buy by selling them at $3.50 per gallon.
• How was the cost of the new equipment accounted for in the price? The producer ended up raising prices across the board by $.50 on all
packages, both cartons and gallons, selling at $2.50 and $4.00, respectively.
• What about cost of packaging? Does it cost the same to package the juice in cartons as it does in gallons? Well, I guess not. Plastic is more
expensive than the paper carton we have traditionally used. Also, we had to hire more experienced labor to operate the machine because it is a
little more complicated than the carton machine. We figured that because the demand was higher for the gallons – we would cover our costs
through increased volume.
• What about overhead costs? All costs for the factory are added together and divided by the number of units produced.
o This should raise alarm bells. This is now clearly an issue of cost allocation. The price on the plastic gallons should be higher due to
higher costs. Now you need to see to what extent this is affecting the bottom line.
Let's try to understand the trend in sales. What percentage of gallons versus cartons is sold? The more our customers notice the gallons, the more
they like them. As the overall volume is increasing, plastic gallons have comprised 60% of the sales. The owner has been very pleased about that.
• It seems to me that it costs more to package in the gallons, yet the price is not higher on a per ounce basis. In fact, it's lower. Have you done any
proper cost allocation to determine which type of product should carry which costs? No, we haven’t.
Key Findings
• The major finding in this case is the additional costs associated with the plastic gallons were averaged out over all units, including cartons. This
resulted in a misallocation of costs and inappropriate pricing.
• The plastic gallon products have been priced at a lower rate than they should have been. Result: the more gallons the juice producer sold, the more
profit the company lost out on.

Recommendations
• This firm should conduct a thorough analysis of activity based costing to determine the overhead costs and direct costs associated with each item
in the product line. They should then use this data to price accordingly."
"(Chemical Manufacturer)
Question
A major chemical manufacturer produces a chemical product used to preserve foods in containers. Despite an increase in market share, the manufacturer
has experienced a decline in profits. The CEO of the company is worried about this trend and hires you to investigate.","Recommended Solution

High Level Plan of Attack
• The first thing we need to figure out is what does ""an increase in market share"" mean? Remember, the term ""market share"" is a percentage, and not
an absolute number. It could imply that the company has increased its share of the market by beating out the competition, or the competition
exiting the market. It could also mean that the market is actually shrinking, but the sales of the company are decreasing by less than those of its
competitors.
Lay Out Your Thoughts
• Use the Profitability Framework. Lay out factors that you feel would help from the Value Chain analysis, 4Cs, and 4Ps.

Dig Deeper: Gather Facts
• Has the company experienced any significant increase in cost in the last couple of years related to any additional fixed or variable cost? No, costs
have been steady.
• On the revenue side, has there been an increase in the volume of output? Slightly, a little bit higher than the industry average.
• What about the competition. Have there been any new entrants on the scene? Actually, competition has decreased. A number of players have
exited the industry.
• Why has that been the case? They were losing money. They felt that the industry had gotten saturated, so they left.
• Has sales decreased for the industry overall? Yes, there has been a general negative trend in the last few years. There certainly has been less
demand for the product.
• Are substitute products being used? Not really. Preservatives in general are being used less in foods. Fresh food is now the preferred choice for
many consumers.
• What about the makers of food? Are they experiencing decreased volume? Yes, the entire industry has been slowing.
• Are they forced to lower their prices to survive? They certainly are. Additionally, to lower costs, they are using their leverage to renegotiate price
structures of raw materials.
• So is the company in question forced to lower its prices? Yes. They are gaining market share, but it's because of a number of competitor fallouts.
• But costs have stayed the same? Yes.

Key Findings
• The industry overall is shrinking. To survive, the company in question has been competing on price. It has gained market share at the expense of it
competition, forcing some to exit the industry.
• Its sales have only increased slightly.
• The decrease in price has caused the company to lower its profits, despite the increase in market share.
• Profit margin has been lower on a per volume basis.
Recommendations
• Focus on cost reduction. If price is the only way to compete, then costs must decrease.
• Collaborate with the competition to increase leverage in negotiation.
• Diversify into other chemicals that are in demand. Reduce the risk of market trends via a portfolio of products."
"(VieTire)
Question
A tire manufacturer in Vietnam, VieTire, has been the only player in that market due to high tariffs on imports. They dominate the tire industry. As it
stands, the tariff is 50% of the total cost to produce and ship a tire to Vietnam. Because of the forces of globalization and lower consumer prices, the
Vietnamese government decided to lower the tariff by 5% a year for the next ten years. VieTire is very concerned about this change, as it will radically
alter the landscape of the industry in Vietnam. They hire you to assess the situation and advise them on what steps to take.","Recommended Solution

High Level Plan of Attack
• The first thing we need to understand is the current cost structure of VieTire's product.
• Next, we must determine the impending competitive situation.
• Then, Calculate the impact the reduction of tariff will have.
• Finally, recommend specific steps that VieTire can take to protect themselves from increased competition.
Lay Out Your Thoughts
• Specify what steps we must take to understand the cost differences now, and in the future, of VieTire and its competitors
Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations
• What would you say are the major costs associated with making a tire? Raw material comprise about 20% of the cost, labor 40%, and all other
costs such as overhead 40%. The average tire cost about $40 to make.
• It seems that labor is a major cost, $16 per tire. Why? Things are done more manually. Most of technological advances in the industry have not yet
been implemented in Vietnam. What about the cost structure of the competition? An average tire manufacturer in the US produces tires at a cost of
$30 each.
o Assuming shipping cost to Vietnam of $4 each tire, and a tariff of 50%, the average cost of an imported tire in Vietnam amounts to $51.
So currently, even though the cost to produce a tire in the U.S. is much cheaper due to technological advances, foreign competitors are out
of luck because of the tariff.

Year Tariff Cost Result of Competition
Now 50% $50.00 Will not enter
1 45% $47.90 Will not enter
2 40% $46.00 Will not enter
3 35% $44.50 Will not enter
4 30% $43.00 Consideration of entrance if willing to take a cut on price
5 25% $41.30 Preparing to enter
6 20% $39.60 Entered the market
7 15% $38.00 Competing on the market

Key Findings
• Depending on what price they are willing to set, the competition will start to think about entering the market in year four. In year six, the
competition will surely enter as their prices become lower than domestically produced tires.
• This analysis assumes that the cost structure for the competition will remain constant. It is important to note that because of the rapid advances in
technology, chances are that the costs of producing tires will decrease resulting in competitors entering the market even sooner.
Recommendations
• VieTire needs to benchmark against word class tire manufacturers and reengineer production methods and cost structures.
• They must invest in the latest advances in order to reduce their labor/operations costs.
• The company should focus on increasing the skills of labor while at the same time contain their hourly wage.
• Need to develop loyalty from their customers/consumers in order to lock in a certain percentage of the market share."
"(World View)
Question
A cable TV company from Canada, World View, had recently entered the US market in the northeast to expand its market share. World View saw this
move as an opportunity to capture a large part of the US market (4MM consumers) in a market with very little competition. However, in the last couple of
years, much to the surprise of management, World View has been unable to make a profit. You have been hired to figure out why and advise them on their
next move.","Recommended Solution

High Level Plan of Attack
• We need to understand why the company is losing money despite the market being uncompetitive.
• We must analyze both the revenue and cost side of the problem.
• We should also analyze the differences in viewing behavior and income between the customer base of World View in Canada and in the northeast.
• We will also determine the strength of any competitors and substitutes.

Lay Out Your Thoughts
• Use the profitability framework.
• Focus very heavily on the consumer.

Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations
• Let's look at costs first. Did World View incur additional costs per customer on average in the new market? No, based on the potential number of
subscribers, they have instituted the same system that was in place. Costs associated with cable wire, debt, maintenance costs, etc. are all
proportionally the same.
• What about the number of subscribers. Out of the 4MM potential customers, how many are signed up? Only 2.1 MM.
• Are other cable companies capturing the remaining market? No, competition is not an issue. Those that we have not acquired as customers simply
do not have cable.
• What about substitutes and viewing behavior? How is the consumer in the northeast US different from the one in Canada? Well, the Canadian
consumer does not rely much on local stations for watching TV. Cable is a major source of entertainment and news coverage. In the northeast
US, we tend to see consumers shy away from paying the $40 a month. They settle for watching local stations.
• Does the new market lave a lower income level? Yes, they do, by about 20% on average.
• What about the local stations? How many are they? Do they meet most of the needs of the consumer? There about 16 local stations that have
coverage over the entire northeast. I guess they are doing pretty well by providing programming that the consumer wants. You tend to see the
average consumer in the northeast watch regular TV more than Cable when compared with the Canadian consumer.
• Do these stations have good reception and how much do they charge? They have a very good reception and they are part of basic TV, so they are
free.
• Is World View providing any type of programming that the local stations are not providing? Some, but the consumers don't seem to be interested.
They don 't feel that it's worth $40.
Key Findings
• There is a great deal of competition in the area, not from other cable companies, but local TV stations.
• The consumer in northeast US is quite different from the consumer in Canada with respect to television viewing habits.
• Consumers are not willing to pay $40 for a service that they already get for free.

Recommendations
• World View could try to cater its current channel offering by offering a smaller package for those that would be interested in couple of cable
channels.
• Scale back its operations to a specific region.
• Educate the consumer on the extra benefit and new low price.
• If none of these strategies work, move out of that market."
"(Le Seine)
Question
A French soft drink company, Le Seine, is looking to diversify its holdings by investing in a new fast food chain in the US. You are hired to determine
whether they should pursue this path and, if so, how they should go about execution.","Recommended Solution
High Level Plan of Attack
• Understand the company's logic for entering into the fast food industry.
• Examine the overall trends in the fast food industry, and determine which segment is the most promising.
• Assess the overall demographic changes and major trends in eating habits.
• Determine what competencies the company can provide that will help it enter this business and be successful.
• What are some of the high level strategies that the company should consider when entering?
Lay Out Your Thoughts
• Use some elements of the 4Cs, 4Ps, and Porter's Five Forces. Identify which factors you need to address and list them in a logical sequence.

Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations
• Why is the company thinking of investing in the fast food industry and not another? The fast food industry has been experiencing sustainable
growth for the last few years, and we believe that it will continue to grow.
• Why in the US market and not the French? The US is more attractive economically and Le Seine has been present in the country for a few years.
• Does the company know much about the fast food industry and its consumers? Not very much. They're not sure where to enter.
• The industry as a whole might be growing, but let's think about which segment is growing the most and where it would make sense for the
company to enter. If we look at the traditional burger outfits, that segment is pretty much dominated by three players: McDonalds, Burger King,
and Wendy's. I would think that the barriers to entry are pretty high for this segment. You also have pizza, Mexican, chicken, cold cut sandwiches,
prepared meals (Boston Market).
• Has the company thought about which to enter? No. But what do you think, at a high level, which segment should they enter?
o [Quickly run through the pros and cons of the various segments]
• Well, if we take a look at the company itself, it is more inclined to be in the prepared meals segment, given that it is French and has a European
appeal. If we look at the trends, the population is getting older and more families have two working parents. Also, there seems to be a move
towards eating more healthy foods. If we consider the competition, the segment seems to be at the growing stages, with only one or two known
players. The barriers to entry are certainly not as high as some of the other segments.
• To distinguish itself from the competition, it can make food with a French theme, priced competitively. The company can also set up shop in major
grocery stores, as more people are purchasing prepared foods as part of the their grocery shopping.
• It would be a fair assumption to say that Le Seine can capitalize on its distribution and marketing experience in the US.
Key Findings

• There seems to be potential in the prepared food segment (players like Boston Market).
• Le Seine seems to be a good candidate to enter and take advantage of the present opportunity.

Recommendations

• Based on this assessment, Le Seine should enter on a large scale. To offer competitive pricing, they must have economies of scale.
• Quickly develop strong brand equity. Look at the franchising option. Examine in detail how the most successful fast food outlets operate.
• Consider acquiring an existing chain versus starting a brand new one.
• Location is extremely important. Know your customers in every region, and focus on convenience."
"(Beer Brew)
Question
A major US beer company, Beer Brew, recently entered the UK market. Two years after entry, the company is still losing money. Despite
a high per capita consumption of beer in the UK market, sales have been very disappointing. What explains this phenomenon?","Recommended Solution
High Level Plan of Attack
• Evaluate the product mix of the company and compare it to what is selling well in the UK.
• Analyze what type of marketing Beer Brew is using.
• Understand the consumer behavior and tastes, and determine the effect on sales.

Lay Out Your Thoughts
• Use the profitability framework. Understand which factor under revenue or costs is driving the decline in profitability.
Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations
• Let's begin with the product mix. What kind of beer has Beer Brew been trying to sell? Currently, Beer Brew is selling two kinds of beer, a strong
tasting and a light beer.
• How have the sales of both been doing? The strong tasting beer is selling slightly below average and the light beer is not selling at all.
• What about marketing? The company has spent more on marketing than the industry average for that region.
• Is it a highly competitive industry? It's about average. The industry is fairly fragmented. There are no dominant players.
• Any problems with distribution channels? No.
• What about pricing and placement of the product? To be competitive, Beer Brew undercut its price significantly to try to capture customers. Their
beer is sold just about everywhere other brands are sold.
• What are the current best sellers of beers in the UK? Guinness, Toby, and a few others.
• What kind common characteristics do they have? They are all moderate in alcohol level, dark, and strong tasting.

• How does that compare to Beer Brew's products? Beer Brew's strong tasting brand is higher in alcohol, and market tests show that it tastes better.
The light beer is low in alcohol and calories, and again tastes great.
• Are there any light beers on the market? Very few. Mostly locally produced. Beer Brew saw this as an opportunity to cash in on the light beer
industry that has taken the US market by storm.
• What about color? Are Beer Brew's two products dark beer? No, they are fairly light in color.
• Since most of the beer consumed in the UK is dark, and dark signifies strong beer, does the light color of the beer signal to the consumer that
somehow the beer is weak? Perhaps, but the company figured that once the consumer tried it, the color wouldn't make any difference.

Key Findings
• It seems that the consumer in the UK has unique drinking habits. After further inquiry, we find that the average British drinker values dark beer
over any other factor. It seems that the dark color has a psychological impact on the consumer, relating it to strength, masculinity, getting their
money's worth, etc.
• The light beer industry is undeveloped in the UK because the health movement in the US has not mobilized in Europe yet.
• Also, because the price of Beer Brew's products is much cheaper than other brands on the market, it is portrayed as a low quality ""American beer.""
There has been a dilution of the brand equity.
Recommendations
• Change the color of the stronger tasting beer. Make it darker and advertise it as the better tasting darker beer, with more alcohol.
• Match the price to other premium beers that focus on the same market segment.
• Drop the light beer product line. The UK is not ready for it yet."
"(Wheeler Dealer)
Question

A major auto service chain, Wheeler Dealer, has enjoyed healthy returns on its 30-store operation for the past 10 years. However,
management feels that the chain needs to expand, as the current geographical areas in which they are based have become saturated.
For the past couple of years, they have aggressively pursued a growth strategy, opening an additional 15 stores. However, it seems that this
approach has had negative returns. For the first time in over a decade, the chain's profits dropped into the negative zone. You were hired to
figure out why.","Recommended Solution

High Level Plan of Attack
• You need to understand the nature of the business. What does the auto service entail?
• Focus on the customer segmentation. Are they serving more than one customer? Any differences?
• What is the profit structure of the different offerings?
• Where did they move? Are the newly formed stores operating differently or serving different markets than before?

Lay Out Your Thoughts
• Use the Profitability Framework. Focus on how revenue has changed given the environment.
Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations
• What type of services has Wheeler Dealer traditionally provided for its customers? There are two main businesses under each roof: off-the-shelf
car parts and the garage mechanical services.
• Are these services provided as well in the newly developed chains? Yes.
• Have competitors entered the market stealing market share? A few competitors have entered the market, but not too many. The expansion was
planned to explore new markets and prevent the competition from growing.

• What about price? Have prices gone up to help defray some of the costs associated with growth? No, they have stayed the same.
• Given the two types of businesses for each chain, do they have the same profit margin? No. In fact, because the garage services cost the business a

great deal more and the mechanics are very well trained, we charge a premium. Profit margin on servicing cars has twice the profit margin of off-
the-shelf products.

• Are the customers the same for both businesses? No. The customer that uses the garage service tends to come from a mid-to-high income bracket.
Those that use the off the-shelf auto parts tend to be of the lower-income bracket. They fix their cars on their own.
• Where has Wheeler Dealer traditionally been located? Mostly in, or very close to the suburbs.
• Has the geographical location changed as they expanded? Yes, They saw certain urban areas as very inexpensive. They located more in inner cities
where there are a lot of used car sales.
• So, would it be fair to assume that the more profitable business, the garage service, has deteriorated and the sale of off-the-shelf parts has
increased, causing overall profitability to go down? Yes.

Key Findings
• The garage service is the major revenue generator for the business. As they expanded into the inner cities, they began to attract the wrong
customer. Profit margin on the off- the-shelf products is not enough to cover costs and make a healthy return for Wheeler Dealer. A price increase
is unlikely given price sensitivity.
Recommendations
• Scale back from the urban areas. Focus on geographical areas where you can attract the suburban customers who will use the service aspect of the
business. Maintain a healthy return on the car product market from the inner city dwellers.
• Where possible, drop the garage service in under-performing areas to reduce costs and focus on the retail end."
"(Travel Agency)
Question
A travel agency makes a 10% commission on all of its travel bookings. Their current profit before taxes is $1MM, while the industry
average ranges from $2MM to $3.5MM. Why are they making less than the industry average?","Recommended Solution

High Level Plan of Attack
• We need to understand the revenue stream and cost structure of the travel agency and conceptualize how each transaction contributes to the bottom
line.
• Focus on the types of customers the agency services and how each type relates to profitability.
Lay Out Your Thoughts
• Use the Profitability Framework, with a focus on the cost side of the equation.
• Break your analysis down to the two types of customers: business and leisure.

Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations
• What is the total gross revenue for the agency per annum, on average? $10 million.
• How does the revenue compare to other agencies with similar size? They are about the same.
• What about the product line? Does the agency handle any bookings other than travel tickets? No. They just book tickets for their customers.
• What are the different customer segments that the agency services? There's the business traveler segment, which comprises about 40% of total
revenue, and the leisure traveler segment with the remaining 60%.
• How many total transactions does the agency process and what is the break down for each customer segment? The total number of transactions is
around one million per year. On average, about 300K go to the business segment, and 700K to the leisure.
• Is there a cost associated with each transaction? Yes, each transaction, regardless of which segment, costs $9.
o [Now you have all the necessary information to calculate the profitability of transactions for each segment. If you run the numbers, you
will find the following information.]

Key Findings
• The leisure travelers are draining your profitability. Either the cost per transaction is too high or the revenue per transaction made on the leisure is
too low.

Recommendations
• Benchmark the cost structure of other travel agencies.
• Negotiate with the airlines on the possibility of charging a premium for leisure tickets or capture a larger commission through cost charged to the
customer.
• Look into the possibility of reducing cost per transaction for the leisure travelers.
• Offer the leisure traveler other products to increase revenue per transaction such as hotel bookings and travel packages.
• Become a niche player and focus only on the business traveler"
"(Hospital)
Question
Our client is a 350-bed hospital in a mid-size city. The organization has historically exhibited strong financial performance, and had a 1-3% operating gain
each year for the last five years. However, they are projecting a $12 million operating loss this year, and expect this situation to worsen in the future. As a
result, the CFO believes that they will be out of cash within five years. They have asked us to identify the source of this sudden downturn, and to come up
with alternatives to restore them to a break-even position. They are one of the largest employers in the market, and will not consider layoffs as a possible
solution.","Background
This question addresses company profitability. The interviewer is looking for a candidate’s business intuition and ability to apply this intuition to identify
potential sources of the problem. In addition, the interviewer is looking for potential solutions to the client’s problem.
Response
Candidate: Profitability is a function of an operation’s revenues and costs. The first thing I’d like to focus on is the company’s future revenue stream.
As I understand the hospital industry, revenues may be fixed for several years due to long-term contracts with insurers. Is this the case for
this hospital?

Interviewer: Your intuition is correct. Revenues have dropped approximately 15% so far this year due to aggressive pricing on capitated managed care
contracts that were signed in January and declining admissions and length of stay for their fee-for-service contracts, most of which are still
reimbursed on a per diem basis. All contracts are binding for three years, and cannot be renegotiated.

Candidate: In that case, it is important to understand the company’s cost structure to see if it can adjust to this declining stream of revenue. Does the

client have considerable fixed costs that will be difficult to reduce in the near term?

Interviewer: Hospital occupancy is approximately 70%, resulting in high fixed costs that are not covered by the current contribution margin. The

organization is currently staffed for 80% occupancy.

Candidate: Since revenue is declining at a fixed rate and fixed costs are high in the short-term, the hospital will have to analyze its variable
cost structure. I would surmise that staffing costs are the main source of variable costs. However, the hospital cannot address
this due to its policy concerning layoffs. I would think that the other main driver of variable costs for the hospital lies in its
utilization of resources. Am I headed down the right track?

Interviewer: In fact, you’re right. The utilization of diagnostic and therapeutic services during a patient’s stay is approximately 15% higher

than what was expected when contract pricing was negotiated.

Candidate: Given that information, the hospital should focus on changing physician behavior since physicians ultimately control the
utilization of resources. The hospital may want to align MD incentives with those of the hospital by sharing risk, giving
physicians data and education on their use of resources versus the competition. Other ways to reduce expenses could be to sign
exclusive contracts with a distributor in order to generate volume discounts and economies in purchasing, or by reducing choice by
limiting the pharmacy formulary to generics and decreasing the number of vendors utilized for high volume items such as prosthetics and
heart catheters.

Interviewer: That’s a good discussion of cost implications, but have you given up on recommending ways to increase hospital revenue?
Candidate: Now that you mention it, the situation is not hopeless in this regard. The hospital may want to increase revenue by signing
contracts with additional insurers, by putting salaried physicians on staff to guarantee that they admit to our client’s hospital, or
by creating an affiliated physician organization to increase their share of admissions. In addition, they can potentially leverage
their distinctive competencies by developing Centers of Excellence that can be marketed to managed care contractors as an
exclusive provider for those services within the region, and possibly outside the region.
Interviewer: Are there any other solutions that may be feasible?
Candidate: One final thought that keeps coming back to me centers on the company’s current competitors. What does the local market look like?
Interviewer: There are two other 350-bed hospitals in the city. One is an academic medical center, the other a catholic hospital recently acquired by a
for-profit chain. Additionally, total admissions in the marketplace have dropped by 5% and total patient days have declined 10%.
Candidate: In that case the hospital may want to consider affiliating with a competitor in the market. This may help to decrease capacity across the
city by rationalizing the services offered at each institution. This may allow one hospital to close, thereby reducing fixed costs.

General Summary Comments
The candidate should fully address the components of this issue (profit = revenue - costs) and should be able to demonstrate an understanding of fixed vs.
variable costs. Moreover, the candidate should be able to brainstorm possible solutions to the problem, both from a revenue maximization and cost
minimization perspective."
"(E-Grocery)
Question
The client is a grocery store chain that is considering whether or not they should enter the emerging Internet-based grocery shopping/delivery market in the
Boston area. This regional chain is currently one of the leaders in the traditional grocery store market in northern New England.
In their core market, two competitors have emerged in the Internet/at-home grocery shopping business, and are rapidly gaining market share. One of the
companies that has already entered this new marketplace is the client's primary competitor in the traditional market. The second player is a chain that does
not have grocery stores in the target region, but has entered the Boston area with Internet shopping delivery services.
Should the client enter the market? If so, how, and what concerns should they have? If not, how do they protect market share from the emerging market
that is threatening to steal business?","Background
This is a market strategy issue. The interviewer is looking for a discussion of the client's customers, competitors, costs, core competencies and the overall
market dynamics. In addition, the candidate should be able to present a solution and identify the key success factors for this solution.
Response
Candidate: The client must first do some preliminary work examining the market for groceries delivered over the Internet. I would like to get a better
sense for the company's current customers, as well as potential customers, to see if the Internet is a viable delivery mechanism for the
company. Can you tell me more about the client's customers in the area?

Interviewer: The client serves primarily upper-middle class customers.

Candidate: That's important to know. I would guess that prospective users of an Internet-based delivery system are upper-middle class. Can you

confirm this and elaborate on the growth prospects for this market?

Interviewer: Your guess is correct. Users of the Internet delivery system are typically upper-middle class. As far as the market is concerned, home
grocery shopping among Internet users is growing rapidly and the percentage of homes with Internet access is also growing.

Candidate: We've established that the market is an attractive one, however I still need more evidence before presenting a recommendation. I'd like to

now turn to the two competitors described in your opening. Can you explain their current market share?

Interviewer: All three local players (including yourself) have an equal market share - roughly 15%.
Candidate: And can you address recent growth trends among the competition?

Interviewer: The competitor without stores in the target region is gaining market share more rapidly than the company with stores in the target region.
Candidate: We've established pretty convincingly that the market is attractive. I'd like to now focus on our client. Clearly not all companies are
prepared to put their operations on the Internet. There are two central issues I'd like to better understand. First, the company's core
competencies—does it have the requisite skills to address the Internet user? Secondly, I'd like to understand the company's cost structure.
Is such a move feasible for the client? Do you have any information on the company's distribution capabilities? Specifically, is it able to
address the Internet market?

Interviewer: The company's current distribution facilities are not adequate for the delivery system.
Candidate: How about the company's employees? Are they sufficiently trained to handle delivery tasks associated with the Internet?

Interviewer: The current employees cannot perform these tasks without more training.

Candidate: Those are some important considerations to ponder. However, given the market attractiveness for Internet groceries, the client would be
crazy to pass up this opportunity. Its customers are Internet users, the competition has already shown a willingness to invest in the market,
and the competitor with no stores in the region (i.e. totally reliant on Internet sales) is growing the fastest. That said, the company must be
willing to invest in this market to succeed. First, it must improve its distribution capabilities. Further analysis must be done as to whether it
should improve its current operations or develop a stand-alone capability exclusively devoted to the Internet market. Next, it must develop
an inventory management system so that it can effectively track what it orders from suppliers, what customers are ordering, and where the
product is delivered (Internet vs. traditional). Finally, it must spend enough money to cross-train its employees so that tasks associated
with Internet delivery can be effectively performed.

Interviewer: Are there any other considerations?
Candidate: When the company rolls out its Internet operations, it must not disappoint customers. Many of the Internet-based customers will be
cannibalized from the traditional operations. In itself, this is not bad. These customers obviously prefer the alternative, and it's better for
the company to retain them versus losing them to competitors. However, failure to deliver on Internet delivery will cause customers to
consider switching to the competition. As such, the company must be sure it can effectively deliver on its promises from the moment it
enters the Internet market.

General Summary Comments
The candidate does not necessarily have to recommend market-entry for this case. If the candidate believes the company should not enter the market, it
must present a compelling business reason why and craft creative alternatives for market share protection. In either case, the key components of market
strategy must be understood and addressed."
"(Formula Producer)
Question

The client is a manufacturer and distributor of infant formula. They sell their product nationwide, and are in the middle of the pack in terms of market
share. They are currently trying to boost their market share while maintaining profitability.

There is a government welfare program called WIC (Women, Infants, Children) that allows individuals living below the poverty level to receive vouchers
for infant formula for their children. Unlike most welfare programs, this one is subsidized by the actual producers of infant formula. On a state-by-state
basis, infant formula producers bid for the right to be the sole supplier of infant formula to welfare recipients in that state.
In addition to paying the government for the WIC contract, the client also provides rebates to retailers for WIC sales. As a result, income received from
WIC sales is substantially less than that received from normal formula sales. In fact, sales to mothers that remain in the WIC program for more than 12
months result in a net loss.

In trying to determine how much to bid on a WIC contract for a given state, what factors should you consider?","Background
This case is fairly wide open, and presents an issue that is most likely unfamiliar and ambiguous. One challenge will be for the interviewee to find one or
more issues that they can explore more in-depth. The basic focus of their analysis should deal with the relative profitability of a WIC contract.

Response

Candidate: I think for this case I would first look at who the typical WIC customer is, and the dynamic of the relationship, meaning how long are they
a customer, and what kind of loyalty is there. Since I don’t have any children, could you tell me more about a typical WIC customer, in
regards to buying formula?

Interviewer: Sure. Obviously the typical WIC customer is poor, since this is a form of welfare. But some things you might not know are that 1) the
average WIC recipient stays in the program for less than 12 months, 2) mothers typically remain loyal to a brand through infancy for their
first child, but for subsequent children recipients often switch back and forth between brands, and 3) infants typically require formula the
first 22 months of their life.

Candidate: Thanks. With that knowledge, I can start to think about the issues facing this company. In trying to decide the terms for the contract,
profitability is the primary driver. There's obviously some issue of social-enterprise here, but even so, I think profitability will drive much
of the decision. Since the WIC recipient gets rebates in addition to the subsidized cost of the product, we need to quantify that rebate in
order to understand what the profitability per recipient is. Can you tell me that?

Interviewer: For the purposes of this interview, let's assume that the rebates average an additional 10% (off of the retail price).
Candidate: OK. So the profit per customer might be determined by (WIC revenue - rebates - COGS). So if the revenue is $100/customer/year, and the
rebates are $10, and COGS are $75, we make $15 per customer per year. As long as we're paying less per customer for these rights to be
the sole-supplier, we're in the black.

Interviewer: For the most part, your logic is correct. But is there anything else that might be a factor in determining profit?
Candidate: Well, related to the actual profitability of the WIC product I'm not sure. But maybe there are some hidden costs or revenues that I'm not
thinking about. In fact, maybe there are some synergistic revenues that the company can achieve. If they get the contract, that gets them
additional shelf-space in the stores. And not just WIC recipients shop in the stores. So maybe they will be able to increase market-share,
just by being on the shelf. Of course, they are getting full retail price for those sales. So I might add in an additional sales minus COGS to
the equation. But to try and get an idea of that figure might be tough. How long to these contracts last?

Interviewer: Typically, several years.

Candidate: Ok, so knowing that a contract is several years, say 5, we can begin to get a total dollar value for the contract. If we know how many WIC
recipients there are in this state that we're bidding, we can calculate expected revenues. Also, if we can get an idea of how much shelf
space we would have, we can quantify the synergistic sales.

Interviewer: Good. I'm not going to make you go through the math on it, because we're about out of time, but you're right. There are 1.2 million WIC
recipients in the state, and shelf-space is awarded based on volume sales. So for this company to get the contract, it can help them have
more sales volume, and thus more shelf-space, and hopefully then more market share.

General Summary Comments
Ultimately, they should come up with some sort of explanation for how numbers would be run to estimate an appropriate contract bid. One example might
be:

(WIC revenue - rebates - COGS) + (synergistic non-WIC revenue - COGS) >= Contract Bid

COGS takes into account economies of scale.

Real world situation is that synergies are strong, and WIC recipients bounce in and out of program but stay loyal to product for first-borns. Not only are the
synergies positive, but also on average WIC recipients are profitable because they pay retail for nearly half of the formula that they purchase over the first
22 months of their child's life."
"(Pharmaceutical Company)
Question and Background Information
Our client is the U.S. pharmaceutical division of a multi-national corporation. In about six months the division will receive FDA approval to
launch an anti-depressant drug. Despite this apparent good news from the FDA, the U.S. division is not elated. It has concerns over the market
potential for this drug and its ability to reach the key prescribers in this therapeutic category. We have been asked to help determine whether they
should 1) launch alone, 2) co-market with a partner, or 3) sell, license or swap the drug.
The concerns over market potential center on whether the drug can gain adequate competitive advantage in a market segment having two
dominant, patent-protected competitors and nearly 100 generic competitors. Additionally, a higher technology antidepressant, which appears to
offer therapeutic advantages, was recently introduced by a competitor.
Gaining the professional endorsement of psychiatrists is crucial to success in this therapeutic category since they write approximately half of the
prescriptions for antidepressants. However, the division has no experience marketing drugs to this physician group. Consequentl

y, it would have to
hire a sales force and/or enter into a co-marketing agreement to gain access to psychiatrists through someone else's force. The client would be able
to leverage its existing sales force to reach the other half of the prescribers (Internal Medicine Specialist and Family and General Practitioners).
How would you help them decide whether to 1) launch alone, 2) co-market with a partner, or 3) sell, license or swap the drug to a third party?
Commentator: Note here what is being asked, ""How would you help them decide."" What is not being asked is ""Which is the correct option to

choose?"" The Interviewer is looking more for how this problem is approached than for the ""correct"" answer.
Also note that it is totally appropriate to take some time to organize your thoughts before launching into the case discussion.","Response
Candidate: In helping the client decide which option they should choose, I will want to guide them to the option that will create the m
ost
value. To understand main value drivers (i.e., profitability drivers), I will first explore the market attractiveness and our
competitive position within that market in order to determine revenue potential. After that, I will explore the major cost issues.
Starting with the revenue, I'll want to understand first what the overall market revenue opportunities are for this type of drug in
addition to our product specifically. Now, the client expressed concern over the market potential for this drug. How big is the
market and what is its potential growth rate?

Commentator: Here the Candidate has done several things. First, the Candidate has stated the overall objective, value creation. Next, the
candidate stated the method of walking through this problem, looking at revenue by using a market economics and competitive
position framework, then looking at costs.
The Candidate provided a roadmap. Now the interviewer understands the approach and expected direction of questioning. This
helps the interviewer understand the student's thought process - how he or she thinks through business problems.
Interviewer: The overall antidepressant drug market is relatively attractive at $1.1 billion per year and is growing well in excess of the

population growth rate.

Candidate: You mentioned that concerns over market potential center on whether the drug can gain adequate competitive advantage in a
market segment having ""two dominant, patent-protected competitors and nearly 100 generic competitors."" You also mentioned
that a higher technology drug had entered the market. Is the antidepressant market segmented by technology?

Interviewer: Yes.
Candidate: And the two patent-protected competitors along with the 100 generic competitors are within our technology segment?
Interviewer: Correct.
Candidate: So, the overall antidepressant market is attractive at $1.1 billion, but within that market, there are segments based on different

types of technology that may or may not be attractive.

Interviewer: That's correct.
Candidate: What is the technology associated with our client’s product?
Interviewer: Tricyclic antidepressants.
Candidate: How fast is this technology segment growing?
Interviewer: As a matter of fact, substitution by the new technology may cause a decline in sales over the next 5 years. Additionally, the

existing competitive environment is very intense and will only increase if the market shrinks.

Candidate: So, the overall segment is not very attractive.

Interviewer: Correct.
Candidate: What percent of the volume do the two main competitors have?
Interviewer: In our own technology segment, the leader has approximately 10% and the number two player has about 4%. The rest of the 100
competitors each has less than a 2% market share. By comparison, the new technology has captured a 20% market share of the
total antidepressant market.

Candidate: How much will our client's product be able to differentiate itself within our technology segment?
Interviewer: Not much. In a market research study we commissioned, the product was seen as very similar to the number two product in our
technology segment, slightly inferior to the number one product, and slightly better than the generic products. The new technology
was viewed as far better due to a lower level of sedation.

Candidate: So to summarize the market environment, although the anti-depressant market is attractive, the segment that we would be
participating in is relatively unattractive and runs the risk of becoming smaller and more competitive over time. Additionally,
within this unattractive segment, we have limited ability to differentiate ourselves relative to our competitors, and thus, will not
be able to charge a premium price.
I would think that this unattractive market and relatively undifferentiated position within that market would translate to a lower
market share. I would estimate that our share might be lower than either of the branded products given our new presence in the
market, say maybe a 2-4% share and this, like the rest of the segment, would probably decline over the next couple of years.

Interviewer: That sounds about right.
Commentator: In understanding the revenue potential, the Candidate did several key things.

1) Disaggregated the antidepressant market.
2) Established the overall attractiveness of the relevant market segment.
3) Established the client's relative attractiveness to competitors within that segment.
This enabled the Candidate to come to the correct conclusion that an undifferentiated position within a relatively unattractive
market will limit the revenue potential.
Also, note that the Candidate is doing most of the talking. Use the interviewer to clarify questions or provide information, but the
Candidate must lead the discussion.

Candidate: Knowing that our revenue potential is relatively low puts more pressure on minimizing the costs if we were to market the drug. I

want to see what area within the cost structure impacts profitability the most. What percent of net sales is COGS?

Interviewer: About 20%
Candidate: And what is the bulk of the remaining line items?
Interviewer: Most of it is selling expense. There are some overhead/admin and advertising and promotional expenses, but most of it is selling

expenses.

Candidate: So, selling expense is the largest portion of the cost structure, which means that whichever option we choose, launching alone vs.
with a partner will certainly impact the selling expense (in addition to the number of prescribers reached, thus revenue potential).
Commentator: You can pick up good “tips” here. Spend time on things having high impact and feel free to test and see how important they are.
Tests might include how large something is as a percentage of sales, how important it is to the customer, or how much of an
impact it has on manufacturing economies, etc.

Candidate: In understanding the effect of the co-market agreement on number of prescribers reached, I think it would be helpful if I could get

an idea of who makes the purchasing decision.

Interviewer: Well, there are four main parties involved. There are the manufacturers (such as our client), the doctors (who prescribe the drug),
the druggists (who fill the prescription) and the patient (who initiates the transaction). Selling is concentrated on the doctors, since
they are the group that determines if medication is needed and, if so, what type.
Candidate: Is the growth in managed care going to influence the dynamics of this?
Interviewer: Yes, but for the purposes of our work, let’s not address that.
Candidate: So, for the purposes of our work, the doctors make the purchasing decisions, this includes two groups of physicians, the

Psychiatric group and the Internal Medicine/General Practitioner group.

Interviewer: Correct.
Candidate: You noted that we don’t currently have connections to psychiatrists. This group prescribes half of the antidepressants. Can we

launch the drug by only marketing to IMs and general practitioners and ignoring psychiatrists?

Interviewer: No, they are at the top of the pyramid of influence and thus must endorse the drug before their colleagues in the IMP/GP will

endorse it.

Candidate: So if we are to market this product, we cannot do so without the Psychiatric group. The weight of the decision then becomes a

matter of what is the most efficient and effective way to reach them—either through a newly hired sales force or with a co-
marketing agreement.

Interviewer: Correct.
Candidate: What are the advantages and disadvantages of marketing the drug ourselves?
Interviewer: In terms of having our own sales force, the main benefit would be that we would be concentrating on our product only and this
may help sales. On the downside however, the cost of this focus is all attributed completely to our product, and having a
dedicated sales force representing only one product would be expensive.

Candidate: Do you have any other psychotheraputic drugs in development or plans to expand this part of your portfolio through licensing?
Interviewer: Nothing is planned for the next three years.
Candidate: So by entering a co-marketing agreement, the costs of the sales force is spread across several products, and, if the co-marketer did
not have a competing product, then our product would get the appropriate selling attention warranted. Also, since this sales force
has existing relationships with the psychiatrists and doesn’t need to take time to further establish these relationships, sales of our
product might peak sooner. So, all in all, I would think that if we were to market this product, it would be a less costly and higher
value option to enter into a co-marketing agreement rather than go it alone.

Commentator: Here, as with most case interviews, the Candidate has the opportunity to go “deep” into an issue. The Candidate has chosen to
do this here with one type of cost, the sales force. The Interviewer is looking to see if the Candidate can identify some of the key
“value” drivers of the function being explored. In the case of the sales force, the Candidate correctly identified the key value
drivers as being:
1) The ability to spread the cost of a sales call across multiple products.
2) The ability to choose a co-marketer that needs this product in their existing product line.
3) The ability to leverage an existing psychiatric sales force infrastructure to reach peak sales sooner.
Remember, there are many value drivers. We have touched on a few, but don’t be concerned about identifying the “right” ones,
just try to identify what type of issues affect the situation the most.

Interviewer: OK, and what about the third option, to sell, license or swap the drug to a third party?
Candidate: Again, the client would want to choose the option that was more value creating. There could be several reasons for going with the

third option:
1) We might sell our drug because the sum of the promotional or overhead costs may make it unprofitable for us to market
whereas a company having a similar product line might be able to carry this product at a very small incremental cost.
2) We might license it for the same reasons we would sell it.
3) We might swap it if we could find a company needing this type of drug while having a drug that might fit more with our
existing infrastructure.
In any case, for the options being considered, I would want to forecast cash flows and discount them back to see what option is
more value creating before making a final recommendation.
Interviewer: OK, thank you for your input on how to approach this problem.
Commentator: You’ll note here, that the Candidate doesn’t actually make a final recommendation. This is fine. The Candidate has demonstrated
how he would approach the problem, and in doing so, has hit on many of the key issues you would find in a real client case
situation.
Recapping the steps the Candidate took into evaluating the client’s options:
On the revenue side:
1) Segmented the market to the appropriate technology level.
2) Determined that the segment was unattractive .
3) Determined that the client’s product was not significantly differentiated.
4) Concluded that for these reasons, the revenue potential was limited.
On the cost side:
1) Determined that selling expense was a key component to profitability.
2) Determined that the Psychiatric group needed to be included in the selling efforts.
3) Determined that it would be less expensive to co-market vs. go it alone.
4) Determined that there are other considerations to evaluate when comparing co-marketing vs. selling, licensing, or swapping
the product.

Interviewer: Provide summary comments and wrap-up."

Here is a little background information on the scotch industry
The first scotch was introduced in North America in the early 1940s, and grew steadily and rapidly in popularity until the 1960s. The industry
has subsequently declined in volume every year to 1996 at a rate of about 3% per year. From 1996-1998, the volume declined at only 1% per
year for these two years.

What kind of information would you want to understand in order to determine the reason for the steady volume decline up to 1996,
explain the ""kink"" in the volume decline, and then forecast what market volume is likely to do over the next several years?
• Is the answer to slower growth explained by fewer people drinking scotch, or by drinking less overall, or both? (fewer people have been
drinking scotch)

What kind of information would you want to understand in order to determine why fewer people have been drinking scotch?
• Demographics
o Male versus female
o Age of typical scotch drinkers
• Popularity
o Substitute products
o Health reasons

What kind of analysis would you complete to quantify the reduction in number of scotch drinkers?
• Review census work
• Complete literature searches
• Interview customers
• Interview distribution channel members
• Interview other producers
• Complete market research studies
• Review the client's information gathered over time
Here is some additional information on the scotch industry
Scotch consumption has been declining because fewer people have been drinking scotch. Fewer people have been drinking scotch for two reasons.
First is a general decline in the popularity of scotch. Other distilled spirits, such as vodka and wine have increased in volume and become more
popular. Second is a decline in the age group that traditionally drinks scotch (the 35-50 age group). As the baby boomers age, this segment of the
population is growing, so even if popularity doesn't change, the scotch market should improve going forward due to the growth in this segment. In
addition, scotch is becoming more popular, especially the unique single malt scotches.

What information would you like to know about the industry, in general?
• How is the scotch market segmented?
o There are three segments in the market, low-end (such as private label CVS whisky), premium (typically seen on the back bar in a
bar), and super-premium (including Chivas Regal and single malt scotches).

• What are the sizes of the segments?
o 40% of the volume in low-end, 50% in premium, and 10% in super premium.
• Is the scotch market profitable?
o Yes, all segments are economically profitable.
• How is profit concentrated?

o 20% in low-end, 60% in premium, 20% in super-premium.
• What are customer needs?
o Taste (do people like the taste of the scotch -- either in blind taste tests or do they ""think"" one brand tastes better because it has a
darker color, or is a more thick liquid, etc.)
o Fashion (is it fashionable to drink)
o Badge (does the brand make me feel important/different/mature/sophisticated)

Would you think that the scotch industry is profitable? Explain structurally, and elaborate
• High barriers to entry, takes a long time to establish a brand name in scotch
• People are very brand loyal and won't switch easily
• People think it’s bad for your health and it’s difficult to get them to start drinking
• People think it tastes bad and it’s hard to acquire a taste for scotch
• Customers are not price sensitive
• Regulatory pressures are high (high taxes, it’s expensive)
• Competitor intensity is not that high (little price based competition, noticeable, but not outrageous investment in advertising)
• As a result, overall, the industry is very profitable, but volume is declining, so profit is declining

What information would you like to know about the brand?
• What segments do we participate in?
o Only in the premium segment and with one brand
• Where is our brand positioned?
o Tied as the #2 brand with 25% market share of volume (#1 has 35%, #2 has 25%, we have 25%, #4 has 10%, others have 5%)
o Priced slightly above the industry average (10%)

• How have competitors performed?
o #1 has gained share from us, the #4 and other brands, but mostly from us
o #2 has held share
• How profitable are we relative to competitors?
o We all have same cost of goods, differences are in selling costs and advertising costs
o #1 has highest selling costs and advertising costs, #2 has second, #3 has third, and so on
o #1 and we have a price premium, #2 is priced at the industry average, #3 and all others are slightly below the industry average, but
no one is dramatically different than the industry average
o #1 has a lower per unit profitability but has the most share of profit given its highest market share
What are your potential hypotheses that you would want to test to understand our relative performance?
• Customers perceive our brand as having poorer rankings on the key attributes
o We have a disadvantaged taste, disadvantaged badge, but competitive fashion
• We do not have the same distribution/availability as competitors
o We actually have advantaged distribution
• We are priced too high relative to our attributes
o True
• Customers are not aware of our products (advertising awareness)
o False, people remember our advertising
• Customers are not convinced to buy our product from our advertising (advertising effectiveness)
o True, we have very poor advertising effectiveness

Why has our advertising effectiveness been poor?
• We don't spend enough
o True, we spend about 25% too little money
• We don't spend in the right media
o True, we spend a lot on billboards because they're cheap but they don't reach the right audiences
• We don't spend at the right time of the year
o True, we spend a lot at Christmas to get the impulse buyers but we don't get the brand loyal buyers
• Our advertising copy is bad
o True, we have had poor campaigns while the #1 brand has had very good campaigns

How would you determine how much money to spend on the advertising budget?
• Set a target number of customers to reach and a frequency target, and then back out the required investment to achieve the targets, based
on the media used, time of year, quality of layout, etc.
• Spend as much as competitors
o This would require a 100% increase in advertising investment
• Spend the same % of revenue as competitors, or set a % of revenue target
• Look at the competitors, index their advertising investment relative to the price premium they receive, and thus index our investment
relative to the price premium we receive (in other words, #1 brand has a 10% price premium and invests $10MM/year in advertising and
the industry average is $5MM/year. So they have 100% more advertising for a 10% price premium. We want a 0% price premium, so we'd
invest at the industry average of $5MM. Or, we want a 10% price discount, so we'd invest at 1⁄2 of the industry average, or only $2.5MM
per year)
• Continue current spending
• Spend a % of our cost structure
• Do a break-even analysis and spend up to where we are economically break-even

If our goal was to make money, and not necessarily to gain/maintain market share, what might be some alternatives?
• Reformulate the product to change its attributes
• Change pricing
• Reduce costs
• Change distribution
• Change advertising/promotion strategy
• Sell the brand
• Milk the brand

Which of these is likely to offer the greatest profit potential and why?
• Milk the brand
o Because market volume is declining so much, we will never recover the advertising investment to turn around the brand (the best
strategy).
• Sell the brand
o Because market volume is declining so much, we will never recover the advertising investment to turn around the brand, and the
value of the brand declines every year as the volume declines.

• Invest to build the brand
o Convince other producers to spend on advertising so the entire industry convinces more people to drink scotch and all producers
win. We could also encourage people to switch from wine/vodka/other drinks to drink scotch (e.g., link with cigars to appear more
fashionable).

Which of these will be easiest for the company to implement and why?
• Is this the largest brand for the company? (i.e., if this brand declines, will the entire company decline?)
o This brand is only a small part of the company's portfolio.
• Fit with other brand strategies (i.e., are all of the other brands in the portfolio growth brands so that this is the only declining brand?)
• Fit with management time and attention (is there so much time focused on fixing this brand that other brands suffer and offset the potential
improvement in this brand)?
• Because market volume is declining so much, we will never recover the advertising investment necessary to turn around the brand, and the
value of the brand declines every year as the volume declines
• Invest to build the brand
o Convince other producers to spend on advertising so the entire industry convinces m

ore people to drink scotch and all producers
win. We could also encourage people to switch from wine/vodka/other drinks to drink scotch (e.g., link with cigars to appear m
ore

fashionable)."
"(Regional Jet Corporation)
Initial Handout for Interviewee:
Regional Jet Corporation is a U.S. manufacturer of regional airplanes-airplanes with 100 seats or less. Its business consists of two types of
aircraft: (1) jet engine, 80 to100-seat aircraft and (2) propeller, 20 to 30-seat aircraft. In fiscal year 1999, Regional Jet delivered 100 jet engine
aircraft and 150 props. This represented a unit volume increase year-over-year of 10% and 5%, respectively, and revenues of $730 million and
$225, million, respectively.
Although overall profitability for Regional Jet in 1999 was a competitive 5% economic profit margin, profitability varied significantly by business.
The prop business generated a stellar 30% profit margin, while the jet engine business was unprofitable with a margin of 3%. Over the past several
years, Regional Jet has experienced eroding profitability in its jet engine aircraft business. Its prop business, despite being profitable, has been flat
in m
ost recent years.
At a January 5th analyst conference (a meeting with the investor com

munity) Regional Jet's senior management team announced that the company

was com
mitted to managing for value.
To this end, Regional Jet has hired you and a team of consultants to help the company develop and implement the value-maximizing strategies for
its businesses.

For our case discussion today, please focus on the jet engine aircraft business:

Case Summary (for Interviewers only)
Regional Jet Corporation is losing money in one of its two business units: jet engine aircraft. However, the market for jet engine
aircraft is profitable. Although Regional Jet has a parity offering and operating position, it has a disadvantaged overall competitive
position, driven by a pricing disadvantage in serving its large lessor customer segment. Lessors, in purchasing large volumes of
aircraft, have been able to exert significant buying power over our client to achieve large price concessions.

I. Market Economics
An ""A "" candidate should seek to understand market size, growth and profitability, as well as conduct an indirect structural
assessment of the industry, e.g., suppliers, customers. Information to be provided to student if asked, although some may require
prompting:

• Market Size: In 1999, the U.S. jet engine, 100 seat or less aircraft market was ~$5 billion.
• Competitors: There is no dominant competitor in the jet engine, 100 seat or less market. The market leader has 20% market share. There
are 4 other competitors with market share from 12% to 18%. Regional Jet Corporation has ~16% share.
• Market Growth: The market has been growing ~5% (in units delivered) each year for the past 5 years and is expected to continue to grow
5% over the next decade. In 1999, a total of 625 jet engine regional aircraft were delivered to customers.
• Market Profitability: Ask the student whether he/she thinks the market is profitable, and how he/she would go about assessing market
profitability. (Answer to be provided post discussion on structural forces below):
o Supplier Power: The supplier base for regional aircraft parts is highly fragmented and Regional Jet uses approximately 50%
proprietary parts in its jet engine aircraft. Hence, supplier power is low.
o Intensity of Direct Competition: Fairly concentrated market with only 6 jet engine regional aircraft manufacturers. Hence,
intensity of direct competition is low-to-moderate.
o Customer Power: In 1999, there were 225 customers. Types of customers include airlines, aircraft lessors, local and national
governments, businesses and private individuals. Hence, customer power varies by segment.
 Only if the student asks about customer power, share with him/her the following facts: Aircraft lessors (i.e., Regional Jet's
aircraft customers who lease jets to airlines, governments, businesses and individuals) make large purchases (often 20 or
more aircraft) during a buying cycle and hence exploit their negotiating leverage over manufacturers, such as Regional
Jet. Hence, aircraft lessors have high customer power. All other customers have low-to-moderate buying power,
depending on their credit worthiness.

o Intensity of Indirect Competition: Larger commercial jets (100 seats or greater) with longer range manufactured by large
commercial aerospace and aircraft manufacturers can be used on regional routes. However, these larger aircraft are expensive for
customers to operate solely on a regional basis. Hence, intensity of indirect competition is low.
o Barriers to Entry: Jet engine, regional aircraft manufacturing requires significant capital investment in production facilities and
equipment, as well as strong relationships with various labor unions. Hence, barriers to entry are high.
o Based on the information provided thus far, ask the student if he/she thinks the market is profitable or unprofitable. The market is
profitable with the average competitor generating 4% economic profit margins over the past 5 years.

II. Competitive Position
An ""A"" candidate should seek to understand competitors and Regional Jet's offering, pricing and operating position..
Information to be provided to student if asked, although some may require prompting:

• Offering position: Overall, the company's offering position is at parity.
o Commonality: The company's jet engine aircraft has a cockpit that is similar to the industry standard and results in low switching
costs for new customers (pilots and flight crew do not need extensive re-training).
o Performance: The company's aircraft offers a range of 500 miles, which is similar to the market average.
o Maintenance and Asset Life: The majority of the fragmented jet engine aircraft maintenance companies have the capabilities and
parts to service Regional Jet's aircraft. For the aircraft customer, maintenance costs over the life of the asset is in line with regional
jets of the company's competitors. On average, the life of the aircraft is 20 years.
• Pricing Position: Question for the student: Based on the discussion thus far, what does he/she think that the company's pricing position is
relative to competitors? Answer: Regional Jet is pricing below the market average, since it is gaining market share (unit volume is
growing at 10% vs. market growth of 5%) with a parity offering. Hence, Regional Jet is pricing for share, i.e., in 1999 it had a
disadvantaged pricing position.
• Operating Position: Regional Jet's operating cost per aircraft is at parity with the industry. Every jet engine aircraft the company delivered
in 1999 cost approximately the same to produce. The student should recognize that achieving scale is critical to the spreading of fixed
costs, and hence, the lowering of per unit costs.
III. Regional Jets Customers
• Customer Segments: Regional Jet serves 3 types of jet engine aircraft customers:
o Customers who purchase only 1 aircraft in a buying cycle (approximately every 5 to 15 years, depending on the customer)
o Customers who purchase 3 aircraft, and
o Customers who purchase 20 aircraft
• At this juncture, the student should inquire about customer segment profitability. Provide the student with the handout: ""Jet Engine
Regional Aircraft Business - Profitability by Customer
• Description of Segments:
o Customers who buy only 1 aircraft during a buying cycle are comprised mostly of small aircraft customers with moderate-to-high
credit risk.
o Customers who buy 3 aircraft are comprised mostly of medium aircraft customers with moderate credit risk.
o Customers who buy 20 aircraft are comprised of creditworthy aircraft lessors.
• Key Driver of Segment Profitability: If the student has not discussed it already, at this point in the case, he/she should recognize that the 3
aircraft lessors (i.e., Regional Jet's aircraft customers who lease jets to airlines, governments, businesses and individuals) in making large
purchases (often 20 or more aircraft) during a buying cycle exploit their negotiating leverage over Regional Jet. The data to support this
can be quickly calculated by the student by referencing the ""Profitability by Customer Segment"" handout: $408M/60 aircraft = $6.8M
average sales dollars per aircraft from aircraft lessors, compared to $8.4M to small aircraft customers and $8.0M from medium aircraft
customers. [Ask the student to compute average price by customer segment, if he/she has not done so without being prompted.] Of course,
the student should be able to conclude that the main driver of profitability between segments is solely price without doing any math, since
operating cost per aircraft produced and delivered is the same regardless of the intended customer.
IV. Overall Competitive Position
Question for the student: Does he/she think that the company's overall competitive position is advantaged, disadvantaged or at parity?
Answer: Regional Jet is competitively disadvantaged overall with negative profits (compared to a profitable market) driven by a disadvantaged
pricing position, particularly to the large lessor customer segment.

V. Alternative Generation
Key Question: What are some strategy alternatives that Regional Jet can pursue in order to improve its jet engine aircraft profitability?
• Potential alternative #l: Aggressively pursue new small and medium, non-aircraft lessor customers and do not increase sales
to existing aircraft lessor customers.
o Ask the student what key questions he/she would seek to answer in the evaluation of this alternative. Key risks may include a slow
road to profitability and unlikely to result in the doubling of the jet engine aircraft business' value. Ask the student to compute
how long it would take for Regional Jet to double the economic profit of the business given the company acquires new small and
medium, non aircraft lessor customers at the market growth rate of 5%.

• Potential alternative #2: Aggressively pursue new small and medium, non-aircraft lessor customers and do not serve any aircraft lessors.
o Ask the student what key questions he/she would seek to answer in the evaluation of this alternative. Key risk may include the
inability to achieve scale (currently at 100 units, with 60% of units purchased by aircraft lessors), and hence, profitability in any
customer segment.

• Potential alternative #3: Regional Jet to increase its negotiating leverage vis-a-vis aircraft lessors by entering the aircraft leasing market.
o Ask the student what key questions he/she would seek to answer in the evaluation of this alternative. [See discussion below]
• Others?
Potential Alternative #3: Enter the Aircraft Leasing Market
Some facts to share with the student:
• The jet engine, regional aircraft leasing market is large and growing
o In 1999, the new aircraft leasing market represented almost 50% of all new aircraft delivered (with operating leases comprising
half) and is expected to grow 5% per year.

• The aircraft leasing market is profitable with the average competitor generating ROEs of ~15% (cost of equity ~10%).
• Three aircraft lessors (also Regional Jet's customers) dominate the market wish a combined share of 65%.
• The key driver of profitability is cost of funds.
• Regional Jet currently provides vendor- or manufacturer-financing on a very limited basis in the form of leases.
• Regional Jet would be at parity in terms of cost of funds.
• Regional Jet has marketing relationships with all aircraft end-users who are leasing their aircraft from the company’s aircraft lessor
customers. Regional Jet works with these end-users to help them configure the plane during the front end of the sales process."
"(British Times)
Case Background:

You're a new senior strategy associate and have just finished your orientation training. You are immediately assigned to our British Times team.
The British Times is an upscale, highly respected newspaper. It is the most widely read newspaper in Great Britain, especially its very strong
business and financial section. The paper is a cross between the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, both in content as well as in
reputation.
The team has already had one meeting with the newspaper's online spin-off: BritishTimes.com. You are going to join the team for the second
meeting, which will be held with only the CEO of the BritishTimes.com. Currently, their web site is nothing more than an online version of the
newspaper, otherwise called brochureware.
The newspaper's and the web spin-off’s single biggest asset is the highly respected brand name: British Times. The purpose of this second meeting
is for the consulting team to present its response to the CEO's current predicament: how to realize greater revenues from their current online
spin-off (BritishTimes.com).

Company Background:
Your team has provided you with the following information as background about BritishTimes.com:
• BritishTimes.com conducted a viewer survey, receiving a high enough number of responses to be statistically significant, allowing them to
feel comfortable using the following information for planning purposes.
o Their web site has a large number of hits, only 30% fewer unique visitors than the number 1 site in the UK.
o Their hits are from viewers in the 75th percentile of customer income.
o Their viewers are also highly educated: 60% have a university education and 30% of whom have graduate degrees.
• BritishTimes.com is a spin-off from the newspaper.
o However, the same parent corporation owns both.
o The CEO of the dot-com does not report to the CEO of the newspaper.
o The dot-com CEO has worked for the newspaper for a long time and knows its operations well.
• The brand name is very strong in the UK, but not outside.
o The newspaper's content is primarily focused on the UK, but it does have an international section.
o The CEO wants the dot-com to use the newspaper's content and brand, but otherwise has no need to connect to the newspaper.

Your Challenge:
Create 3 or more ideas for the BritishTimes.com company to increase their revenue through their Internet strategy.","Possible Solution:
Candidate: In general, it's fair to say that the bulk of Internet revenues comes from three sources: advertising, subscriptions, and transactions. I
think that the key to helping the CEO is to tailor these initiatives to British Times.com core assets.
[Great way to start. The candidate did not try to use an ill-fitting framework such as 3Cs or 5 forces to approach this case. Instead he's showing a
good understanding of the Internet's major sources of revenues. He also acknowledges that further discussion of the company's core assets is
critical to formulating a robust solution.]
Interviewer: Good points. Can you give me more details on each of these sources of revenues?
Candidate: Well let's look at advertising first. We could suggest two avenues: banner ads and corporate sponsorship. Upscale or corporate banner
ads such as insurance companies, banks, or brokerage firms would make a lot of sense with our audience. They are highly educated and more
importantly, have the highest level of disposable income. In addition to banner ads, we should look into corporate sponsorship. We should take full
advantage of the fact that the strong business section can obtain corporate sponsorships; for example, banks or e-trade companies pay for their
section of the site.
[Well-structured answer. The candidate is using the case facts to support his answer.]

Interviewer: Good. They do some of that already but probably not as much as they could. You also mentioned other sources of revenues. Could
you explain your subscription model?
Candidate: We could imagine a three-tier approach. For example, in tier 1, readers could have access to today's news for free. For a small fee,
Tier 2 subscribers could research up to one-week-old articles in the archive. Finally, in the last tier, subscribers could have access to the entire
archive.
Interviewer: Coming from a traditional publishing company, they are fairly familiar with these two models. I would be interested in hearing more
about your third option.
Candidate: One way to ""monetize"" their attractive audience would be by offering targeted products and services. Some examples could be a
tollbooth model similar to Amazon Z shop concept or selling tabs on their site. This would clearly require a deep analysis of the competitive
landscape and of the company's capability (technical, people...) to start a completely new line of business.
These products or services would have to be:
• High margin,
• Upscale,
• Highly profitable vertical businesses; for instance: golf store, tax advice, investment advice, upscale travel (cruises, etc.)
Interviewer: Golf equipment? This is interesting. How would you go about sizing the market for golf equipment in the UK?
[The interviewer decides to test the candidate’s ability to do some real time analysis, to articulate a methodology, and to make reasonable and
explicit assumptions in order to arrive at a ballpark estimate. Here the interviewer could have chosen to discuss more in detail how the candidate
would have thought about launching a completely new line of service.]
Candidate: To determine the golf store's (equipment only) first year total revenue, we would have to figure out the following:
• The population of the UK
• The percentage connected to the Internet in the UK
• The number who browse this site
• The number who browse the golf store
• The number who buy from this site: the buy to browse ratio
• The average amount spent per transaction
• The number of times they buy per year
• The commission received by BritishTimes.com

There are approximately 60 million people living in the UK. If we assume that a third of them are connected to the Internet, we have:

60M x 1/3 = 20M

[It's always a good idea to take numbers that are easy to manipulate. Do not hesitate to round up the number to help your calculations. The
examiner is not looking for an accurate answer.]
If we assume that 20% of the people connected will visit the British Times site, we now have:
20M x 20% = 4 million visitors

Not all of them will click on the golf site. Probably about 20% will do. We can now estimate the number of people browsing the golf site:

4M x 20% = 800,000 visitors

If we assume that only 10% of them will actually purchase on the site, we now have:
800,000 x 10% = 80,000 buyers.

Each buyer may spend on average $100 each time they visit and they may visit the site 2 times each year.
If we assume a 5% margin, we now have a rough idea of the golf equipment first year revenues:
80,000 x $100 x 2 x 5%= $800,000"
"(Children Clothes E-Retailer)
Part 1:
Case Situation:
It's a Friday afternoon. You've just accepted an offer to join our consulting company as a Senior Associate in the Business Strategy Competency.
You've just called in to confirm your start time on your first day and find out you have an excellent opportunity to be the lead business strategist
on a high profile project. We have partnered with a leading bricks-and-m

ortar children's apparel retailer to help them analyze, design, and build

their Internet strategy. There will be a kick-off meeting for the project with the client (including the client's CEO) on Monda
y m
orning. The
Principal/Engagement Leader on this project has asked you to lead a discussion about how the client should think about opportunities on the
Internet. Right now, the client only has a marketing and informational presence on the web (a.k.a. ""brochureware""). The Principal/ Engagement
Leader wants the client to think about the range of opportunities and challenges the Internet presents and whether the client should invest
aggressively in pursuing any initiatives.

Company Background:

The client's web site and some associated articles found on the Internet have provided the following information.

• The client is a publicly traded company with a $3B market cap. The share price has risen from $15 to $45 in the past 12 months.
• The client has 300 stores, m

ostly east of the Mississippi, and all stores are within the U.S.
• Revenues are approximately $250M, and the firm has average profitability for its industry.
• The client has been on a rapid store expansion program adding about 25 new stores each quarter for the past two years. They claim to
expect similar growth going forward.
• The market for this client is clothing for children 12 and under. Sales are roughly split between boys and girls.
• The company is vertically integrated: It designs all its own products, has deep relationships with contract manufacturers in Asia, and
distributes all of its products through company owned stores.
• The company sells a high quality product that is priced about 25-30% lower than its chief competitors.
• The company has done only limited marketing. The brand remains relatively unknown.

Your Challenge:

• Plan for the client meeting. Structure the problem at hand. What questions would you ask?
• Then, work with your interviewer to explore and broaden those questions and brainstorm the client's hypothetical responses.

Part 2:

Quantitative Analysis:
After spending part of the weekend preparing for your kick-off meeting and discussion facilitation, you check your voicemail from the airport
before hopping onto the shuttle on your way to the client's office for the meeting. The one new message is from your Principal/Engagement Leader
asking you to provide an estimate of the size of today's online component of domestic children's apparel sales and how large it might grow in the
next 5 years. As you step onto the plane, you realize that you'll have no access to the Internet or other research before the meeting starts. Instead,
you will need to create a ""back-of-the-envelope"" analysis on the plane.

Your Challenge:

Spend about 5 minutes creating an answer to these two questions:
1. What would you estimate the size of today's online component of domestic children's apparel sales today?
2. How large do you think it will grow in the next 5 years?
[The point of this scenario is to test the candidate's ability to do some real time analysis, to articulate a methodology, and to make reasonable and
explicit assumptions in order to arrive at a ballpark estimate.]","Possible Approach:
To present the best solution, the candidate must have a better understanding of the customers, the competitors and the client. Some of the
important questions to ask are:
Market and Competitive Landscape:
• What are the main trends and dynamics going on in the client's industry?
• What are their competitors doing?
• Who are they?
o What are the brick-and-mortar children's apparel retailers doing?
o How are they using the Internet: Has there been a direct causal relationship to their revenues and/or expenses from their Internet
strategy and implementation?
o What are the Internet pure play apparel retailers doing?
o Who could some of the oblique or peripheral competitors be?
o Would they be likely to enter the market?

Customers:
• Who are the client's customers?
• What is the value proposition to the client?
• What are the trends in the customer base over time?

Client:
• What are the client's goals?
o To increase revenues? To reduce costs? To increase market capitalization?
o How could different Internet initiatives accomplish each of these goals?
o Are these the right goals for the client to have?
o What are the client's organizational capabilities?
o Are they capable of supporting an Internet initiative with the existing culture? Talent? IT infrastructure, legacy, processes?
Operational structure, processes, procedures, policies? Accounting processes?

[The goal of the interviewer is to assess the candidate's ability to analyze and develop questions for the client to answer. The interviewer will often
play the devil's advocate and challenge the hypothesis the candidate generates.]

Possible Response
Assume the children's apparel category is dollars spent on clothes for kids ages 12 and under, as stated in the case facts.
There are approximately 275M people in the U.S., perhaps 15% are under 12.

275M x 15% = approximately 40M kids under the age of 12.

Assume the average parents spend $250 on each kid age 12 or under each year.

40M kids x $250 = $10B children's apparel industry for kids 12 and under.
Of the people who spend this $10B, assume 35% of them have Internet access and have the potential to shop online.
Therefore, the theoretical current maximum potential size of the market is $3.5B.

However, just because people use their online access to buy their kids' clothes doesn't mean they spent all $250 for each child online for their
apparel. In fact, only a small fraction of those dollars are spent online today, perhaps 5% (a.k.a. share of wallet).

5% x $3.5B = $175M (which is not too far off the actual estimate of $130M in 1999-Forrester Report)

In the next five years, let's assume the number of kids increases to 42M, average spending goes to $300 per kid age 12 and under, Internet access
rises to 55% and share of wallet rises to 20%.

The 5-year growth estimate would be:

42M kids x $300/kid x 55% x 20% = $1.4B (which is not too far off the Forrester estimate of $1.6B)."
"(Consumer Products)
Case Situation
It's Monday morning and as a new Principal/Engagement Leader, you've just gotten a call from a well known and respected French-based
Consumer Products company. The company has offices in the US and has been selling through traditional channels throughout its history. It
designs and manufactures plastic products like pens, pencils, disposable razors, etc. It's an old company that's been around for about 60 years and
wants to take advantage of the Internet, starting with the US sales.
Company Background
You talked at length with the President of the dot-com part of the company and this is what you learned:
• This company now wants to sell directly to consumers through their Internet site.
• Their current online business is nothing more than a small catalog and is not doing very well: sales and hits are less than expected.
• It offers:
o More convenience than their other channels. It is open 24x7 and has more product information.
o But, limited selection: only high margin items.
• The President's strategy is to add key functionality to the online business to increase the hit rate and improve revenue.
• She reports directly to the CEO
• She wants your consulting team to create:
o A multi-ship-to-functionality,
o A site-wide search functionality,
o An ability to add checkout sales (e.g. impulse buy items similar to end caps in grocery stores next to the register).
• She wants your consulting team to build this immediately.

Your Challenge:
This coming Thursday, you will meet with the President and her team.
Her expectation is that you will present a plan for your consulting team to build the functionality ASAP.
• What will you do on Monday?
• What will you prepare?
• What questions will you ask the President?
• What is your goal for that meeting?","Candidate Response:
There are many ways to answer this challenge, but the candidate should at least know not to accept the client at face value, realizing that the
functionality the President wants will not materially improve the hit rate or revenue, at least as far as the information provided indicates.
The candidate should want to create a conversation with the President and her team to present the plan for delivering the functionality (or state that
there is a plan), primarily to gather additional information to better understand the online company's business issues and goals. In other words, the
candidate should want to open the eyes of the President and her team through questioning. The candidate will want to offer the notion that the
additional functionality will not solve the pressing problem.
The candidate's questioning of the President should follow a logic path that includes asking about the value proposition of the line store; for
instance:
• Who is the store trying to target?
• What is the store's value to the customer—its real offering (e.g. convenience, price, selection)?
• Why is it a unique and attractive offering?
• How will the online store deliver on the promise?"
"(The Video Store)
Question and Background Information:
Two business school classmates laud their entrepreneurship intentions and mock your interest in entering the management consulting industry.
They decide that despite trends that indicate otherwise, what is needed is a video rental store closer to the HBS campus. They try to convince you
to join, but in your infinite wisdom you instead join a prominent strategy consulting firm in Boston.
Their first two years meet unprecedented success. They buy matching Porches and a townhouse in Beacon Hill. Needless to say, each time you
meet up for social occasions, they share with you (mostly with tongue in cheek) their success and a ""I told you so"" attitude. You handle their jabs
well, as you feel you have had a terrific experience at your consulting firm.
The story, however, changes in about 12 months. Despite two and a half years of dramatic profit and revenue growth, profits have dramatically
fallen. They call you (with a fair amount of egg on their face) and say ""we don't know what happened and our mortgage and car payments are
getting tougher to meet. Can you help us? We know that you help CEO's of large companies get to the bottom of their issues."" With more than a
little satisfaction and justice in your voice you agree to help.
What do you think the problem is?
Suggested Questions:
This is an example of a case where the student must probe to get to the heart of the matter. The student needs to ask questions which first diagnose
the situation and then (and only then) talk about causes of the situation and then (and only then) talk about areas of improvement.
Here are questions that the student should ask to get to the analysis that will help them diagnose the problem:
• Have costs increased?
• Have revenues declined?
• Have prices been changed?
• Have new video stores opened in the area?
• Are fewer customers coming to the store?
• Are customers renting fewer videos?
• Have other entertainment venues opened in the area?
• Have their been economic changes in the area?

These key questions will get behind what is happening (competitive changes, pricing adjustments, macro factors, people not coming to the store,
or people just not renting as many videos, etc.)","Suggested ""Excellent"" Response:
This is an example of a case that is founded in 3C's type issues. The student has to diagnose the problem and find out what exactly is going on and
then find out what is causing it. This is how efficient analysis is performed:
If profits have declined then I assume that either revenues have declined or costs have increased, what is the case?
Revenues have decreased. Why would you think that cost is probably not the problem?
Video rental is a high fixed cost business - rent, videos, and labor are all fixed in the context of rental revenue. Thus, the business' profits will be
susceptible to changes in revenues (capacity utilization). Revenues are made up of the number of videos we rent in a year and the price we charge.
Has the management changed the price of the videos?
No. What does that tell you?

That means that either fewer customers are coming to the store or each customer on average is renting fewer videos. Which is it?
How would you figure that out?

The security system probably has a counter so that could tell us store traffic, and clearly the register receipts could give us number of videos rented
per day. We can look at that data last year versus this year and determine whether there is a traffic problem or share of wallet problem.
Excellent. If you found out it was a share of wallet problem, what would you think might be the problem?
Share of wallet problems are often driven by internal execution problems (bad selection, poor service, etc) whereas, traffic is often external (or
market) problems.
Again, excellent. The data shows that traffic has fallen. What now?

[Here the student should begin to think about hypothesis development. They have diagnosed the problem... i.e. fewer customers are coming into
the store.]
If traffic has fallen, it is either a macro factor or a competitive situation. My inclination is that video rentals are not that impacted by economic
factors, so it is probably a competitive situation. Has a new store opened in the area?
No.
Has a new movie theatre opened?
No.

Hmm... That is surprising. I was sure that this was a competitive situation and we have a fixed pool of rental community (or movie interested
community) and that once a new store opened regardless of how good it was, it took share from my client’s store.
Let me ask you something and maybe this will help you along. What business is your client in?
They are in the video rental business or the entertainment business or leisure business... I see there could be other entertainment preference shifts
or options, etc.
That is good intuition, but have you fully defined your client’s business? What does your client do? What purpose to they serve?
They rent movies for people to watch at home. They are in the home entertainment business and specifically in the home movie entertainment
business. That means that the competitive set is anybody who provides movies in the home. Not just video stores.
Excellent. What do you think is going on?

Here the student has now diagnosed the problem and can make a very good hypothesis that either delivery, cable, PPV, or new Movie on Demand
technology has infiltrated the market or is experiencing rapid growth, reducing the market size for video rentals at stores.

Summary Comments
There is no one right way to approach cases. Structure your case interviews to (1) perform structured analysis and fact gathering to properly
diagnose the problem; (2) share your logic and hypothesis whenever you can; (3) drive to an answer/assessment."
"(The English Church)
Question and Background Information:
Assume you are the new pastor of a rural English church in the late nineteenth century. Over the last three years, attendance has been declining.
Your boss has just come to town to tell you that she is considering shutting down the church. You have two weeks to diagnose the problem and
come us with possible solutions.
How would you think through what these problems might be and the possible solutions?","Suggested Sample Response:
There are many potential reasons why the churchgoers of the parish have stopped going to church. First, I will talk about the possibility of
competitive churches; secondly, I will talk about the possibility that people in the area have simply stopped going to church.
There is the possibility of competing churches. There are two reasons why competing churches could be taking our parishioners away: better
location, better religion, or better services. I remember from my history classes in college that some churches were located far away from pockets
of the population, and churchgoers often would establish churches closer to home. Also, sometimes people change what they believe or new ways
of thinking emerge. This could also be driving people to other churches.
I would also want to figure out if the nearby churches are preaching different religions. There is at least a chance that these churches are offering
parishioners a different kind of religious viewpoint that is more attractive than the religion we have been preaching. Their rules regarding
behavior, for instance, may be different from ours.
Lastly, I would want to understand the different services being offered at ""competing"" churches. There may be different value that these other
churches offer that we do not. For instance, these churches might provide childcare, adult education and job training, or singles dances. These
churches may offer more personal attention and guidance from the pastors.
I will also talk about the possibility that people who live in the area around the church simply may have stopped going to church. Off the top of my
head, I can think of two reasons why people may stop going to church: progress and inconvenience. As science and communication advance,
people may rely less on the church to explain the world and more on scientific findings and written forms of communication such as books and
newspapers. This could be happening in our parish. On the other hand, going to church may be becoming inconvenient or economically nonviable.
Maybe our parishioners feel that they need to stay at home to work in the fields in order to maintain subsistence. I would want to talk to these
parishioners to find out why they have stopped going to church
There are many ways I could test my hypotheses. I think the most important thing is to talk to the former parishioners to ask them why they have
left the church and what we would need to do to entice them back. After that, I would want to send someone (or myself) to the other churches in
the area during services to understand what is being preached at these churches. To help prove if the issue is location, I would draw a map of our
current and former parishioners and analyze how distance from the church affects attendance. To understand if there are other churches in the area
taking away our parishioners, I would also map these new churches on my newly created map.
Once I understand why people are leaving, I would devise a plan to bring the parishioners back. I would want to be focused on the needs of my
parish, by offering enhanced services, such as day care as well as flexibility, such as offering services at different times of the day. If distance is a
factor, I may want to consider having services at different locations at different times, making our church more accessible.
Summary Comments
This would be a very good answer. The candidate came up with a number of hypotheses, identified ways to test those hypotheses, and formulated
an action plan to address the issues. This answer shows thoughtfulness, creativity, and structured thinking. While there may be some issues that
this candidate did not identify, he/she does a good job structuring a comprehensive answer. For a 3Cs answer to be good, a candidate does not
have to address every single issue."
"(HBS as a Business)
Question and Background Information:
You are Dean Clark. A wealthy benefactor has come to you with the news that she will give HBS $100 million. The grant is contingent, however,
upon you using the money effectively. You have 1 week to propose to the benefactor where you would use the money before she will finalize the
transfer.
How would you, as Dean Clark, propose to use this money?","Suggested Sample Response:
First, as Dean Clark, I need to think through what does spending the money effectively mean? This is a not-for-profit learning institution, but that
does not mean that it is not a business. For Dean Clark to be successful, he needs to understand what drives his business and where he can achieve
the biggest return for his investment.
There are currently 4 major ""business units"" that provide a revenue stream for HBS. These include:
• MBA program
• Executive Education program
• Publishing
• Grants and donations
While there are many budding initiatives, including distance learning, these are the four largest sources of revenue.
If you rank the relative profitability of these revenue streams, you would likely find that the least profitable of the four is-the MBA program.
Publishing is a very profitable business but it seems to have high reliance on the education business. Executive Education is very profitable, as the
fees charged to the executives are quite large when compared to the length of program. Grants and donations are virtually pure profit.
At first glance one might conclude that HBS should focus their resources and efforts on the highest return areas of securing grants, publishing and
expanding the Executive Education program. It would follow then, that the MBA program would fall as the lowest priority for resource allocation.
That would be an incorrect conjecture, however. Consider what draws people to the executive education program, for example. The brand cache of
HBS drives the attendance and enables the price premium. Similarly for publishing, the value of the HBS brand provides the credibility behind the
content and drives sales. So what drives the HBS brand? Clearly it is the MBA program.
Dean Clark must focus on maintaining the reputation of HBS as the premier MBA program to attract the best and brightest professors and
students. It is then the academic and professional work of these people that contributes to the integrity and value of the brand. Obviously the
professors publish, hence enabling that revenue stream. The MBA students graduate and achieve notable success, further driving the brand.
Finally, the alumni are responsible, to a large extent, for the grants and donations that HBS receives.
In the end, the MBA program effectively ties in every other revenue stream both directly and via the resulting brand cache. Clearly the $100
million is best spent on the MBA program.
Summary Comments
This is not a particularly difficult case but it does assess the candidate's ability to think through the school as a business and reason through to the
underlying driver of that business. A superb candidate will need little to no prompting to think through this case in its entirety."
"(Fast Food Restaurant)
Question and Background Information:
Six months out of HBS, a frustrated classmate calls you to complain that the fast food burger joint that he bought has been steadily losing money
for the last 3 months. He wants to know what you think he should do about it.
Where do you start?
Suggested Questions:
This is an example of a case where virtually no information is provided and the student needs to take a minute to figure out where to start probing.
In this type of case, the student is evaluated based on the number of factors questioned up front plus the ability to logically pare down that list to
get at the heart of the matter.
Here are some of the initial questions the student should ask:
• Have revenues decreased?
• Have costs increased?
• Have prices increased?
• Was the store making money 3 months ago? What has changed?
• Is there new competition?
• Has there been a major economic change in the area?
• Was there a major event like someone getting sick? Health code violation? Crime?
These answers will help to frame the extent of the required analysis.","Suggested ""Excellent"" Response:
What do you mean by ""losing money""? Have profits declined or is the business in the red?
Profits have declined.
Have revenues decreased? Costs increased? or both?
Revenues have decreased.

If revenues have decreased, there are either fewer paying customers or the customers are spending less when they visit. Which is the case?
While they could both play a role, in this case, there are actually fewer customers.
Fewer customers could be due to external factors like new competition, change in eating habits, local changes like a major business closing in the
area. There are also internal factors to consider such as poor food quality, higher prices, or a major event like someone getting sick or a health code
violation. Recognizing that there are likely many factors involved, is the issue primarily internal or external?
The issue is external and is driven by a new competitor that opened across the street.

This new competitor must be offering a better value to have made such an impact on the burger joint. What is their value proposition? Are they
offering a different type of food? Is it better quality? Is there a price disparity?
They serve chicken dinners and appear to offer a completely different experience. How would you get a deeper understanding of their value
proposition?
First, I would visit and learn everything that I can from what I see and experience first hand. How is the quality of the food? Are the prices
reasonable? Do they offer healthier options and more variety? How is the service? Cleanliness? How is the facility laid out? Do they have more
parking? Easier access? Once I get a first hand view of the competition, I would take a hard look at the burger business and the value proposition
they are offering. The same questions would apply.
Next, I would do some primary research including customer interviews at both locations. The focus of these interviews is to discern the differences
in perception between the two locations. 1 would pay some customers to go to each restaurant and rate the food and experience. I would also
determine how many of the customers are former burger customers but now are exclusively chicken customers, versus how many visit both, and
how many are completely new to the chicken place but would not visit the burger restaurant.
Armed with the data on what customers' value, I would then create a set of options to evaluate. There are likely a number of areas that need
improvement including new menu options, improved facility layout, better taste/quality. Which will drive most traffic back into the restaurant
fastest? Which give the largest return on investment? After analyzing the alternatives based on the chosen criteria, I would prioritize them and
develop an action plan to include timing and responsibilities.
[At this point, the case could go in several directions from leadership and project management issues, to brand marketing and promotion, to
financial decisions about whether to close the facility.]
Summary Comments:
This type of case can be very intimidating since it is broad and ill-defined. The interviewer may not provide much guidance or detail; increasing
the stress level. When faced with an interview of this type, the student should try to remain calm and methodical. Writing down the alternatives
and crossing them out as they are ruled out is a good way to show their thought process. Thinking aloud is encouraged. The student should take a
little time in the beginning to frame the issue so as not to develop a hasty hypothesis and head down the wrong path."
"(Automobile Producer)
Question and Background Information:
The director of marketing at an automobile manufacturer suggests changing the current design, where two separate keys operate the ignition and
the doors to a design where one key operates all lock mechanisms.
How do you think about whether this a good idea or not?","Suggested Sample Response:
The goal of any business including automobiles is profit throughput that can be measured by the Net Present Value impact of the proposed change.
For the proposed change to have a positive impact on profit throughput, the change must be a net positive of change in cost structure or product
demand weighed against the investment needed to implement the change. An expanding of demand in this case must come from the product
meeting customer needs better than the direct competition or substitutes. Customer needs that this product may address are simplicity, security,
and cost of ownership (related to security). One should also consider if the improvement is defensible or would be easily copied.
For cost structure, the relative expense of using what is assumed to be the m

ore complex locking mechanism of the ignition on the door and trunk

(assumed 5 locks that would be m

ore complex) would have to be weighed against the reduced cost of developing or purchasing separate key and

lock mechanisms. As m

ost automobile manufacturers are very large, it is assumed that the simpler locking mechanism needed for the doors could
be reused across many product lines or purchased from large parts suppliers who supply the industry as whole and the development cost of a
separate locking mechanism would be low. Therefore, the change in cost structure will be driven by the relative cost difference of buying 6
complex locking mechanisms vs. 5 simple locking mechanisms and l complex mechanism. It is assumed that a m

ore complex locking mechanism
is needed for the ignition. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the net change of cost position is negative. It is also assumed that the market power of
buying m
ore complex locking mechanism would not significantly impact the price charged by suppliers or cost basis if developed internally. This
hypothesis would be easy to check by looking at the relative cost position of the different locking mechanisms and the discount structure available
for mass purchasing the various locking mechanisms.
On the demand generation side, the product would have to create a net positive in demand across the customer needs of simplicit

y, security, and
cost of ownership. The fact that the marketing director suggested this change hints at the fact that customers may demand the increased simplicity
of only carrying one key. This does not seem intuitively true as the two keys are alm

ost always carried on the same key ring so the relative

improvement to simplicity is probably minimal.
For security, there are two factors to consider, the theft of valuables in the car and the car itself. If m

ore complex locking systems were to improve

the security to valuables, then the value of going with the m

ore complex locking system on the doors of the car may be a positive. The assumption,
however, is this is not the case as door locks are typically compromised not by picking the lock but by compromising the areas around the lock
(i.e. Slim Jim). Also, security systems, which are becoming more common on cars, mute the affect of a more complex locking mechanism, as the
key lock mechanism becomes the non-primary mode of defense. I do not see how moving to one key would impact the chance of theft of the entire
car, as in either case the same locking mechanism would have to be beaten. This also means the cost of ownership, which could have increased if
the change of car theft increased due to insurance premiums, would exhibit no affect.
The customer reaction to a single key mechanism could be tested through surveying or product pilots where a sample set of customers are given
actual cars with one key and asked to gauge their reaction. Or larger regional pilots could be run and the change in demand affect measured.
The investment required to implement the change of eliminating a separate key and lock for the doors and ignition is assumed to be minimal as
key locking mechanisms are fairly standardized and the ignition key lock, which is probably more complex, could be transferred to the doors and
trunk with minimal amount of rework of the parts assembly infrastructure for building the auto. The primary investment cost would then be the
cost of piloting or surveying for the increase in customer demand by implementing the change. Surveying and piloting costs can be significant, but
it is assumed a cheaper survey would suffice in this case to gauge demand so investment costs would be minimal.
Three final possible points to consider on demand generation. One, an increase in demand is necessary but not sufficient to improve profit
throughput, as the company also needs to be able to meet the new demand generated. As auto manufactures almost always have an excess of
capacity, this is not an issue. Two, even if this change was beneficial it could be easily copied by competitors and it is assumed that the change
would not provide any lasting brand advantage in the customers mind or raise the demand of the sector as a whole. Therefore, in the long run, the
cost reduction benefits would override the decision to go forward and we have already argued the affect would be negative. A final factor that
should be considered is the assumption that the majority of cars sold in the US in the past have included two keys and the two keys have most
likely generated a lot of unanticipated use that may be hard to anticipate that might cause customers to reject the change. So, from a customer
perspective, I would want to see the demand for this from customers to be strong and the benefits large before implementing a change.
Because it does not appear the proposed change would positively impact cost position or increase demand significantly, the recommendation is
against the proposed change. I recommend even against investing to gauge customer demand as the long run benefit would be in cost position and
the assumption here is that the affect is negative.

Summary Comments
This candidate starts with a framework and works through to a hypothesis and how the answer might be tested. All the customer factors or cost
impact that could be considered are obviously not included, the interviewer should look for a structured presentation that arrives at a hypothesis
with ideas how to test and a proposed answer."
"Shine Metals
Case Question: An entrepreneur has recently bought a metal processing factory and wants you to
design the supply chain system for the finished goods. You are his consultant and how will you
proceed?
Specific objectives:
1) We are concerned only about the outbound finished goods.
2) Minimize Cost
3) Reliable delivery
Suggested structure:
For a supply chain design the candidate should be willing to explore the following
1) Number of Products
2) Number of customers
3) Product demand
4) Transportation
5) Inventory
6) Any warehousing decisions
7) Location of factory
8) Customer location
9) Flow of information
The case is essentially a transportation case. After initial structuring ask the candidate to focus only
on the transportation part. The focus here is to minimize transportation cost and ensure reliable
product delivery.
Provide the following information when asked. But if the candidate doesn’t get here in a few minutes
provide this
1. The factory has only one customer. All shipments are direct from factory to the customer
2. The factory is located in Chicago and customer is in Denver. The distance between the two is
1000 miles
Question: Ask the candidate about various modes of transportation possible. Finally settle in for
trucks
3. The customer demand is 40 truck loads per week
4. Currently the factory is using freight companies which charge about $3 per mile for a truck
load
Question: The client is now considering reducing this cost. How can the client do it?
Some possible answers: Negotiate with contractors to reduce cost, look at alternate freight
companies, buy trucks on its own, lease trucks, shift the plant location to Denver
Instruction: Insist on the leasing option. Ask the candidate what information he wants to decide if
leasing is a cheaper option. The candidate should ask for the following things
- Leasing cost per truck - $1750 per month
- Labor cost (Salary of drivers) - $ 0.5 per mile
- Fuel cost - $0.3 per mile
- Vehicle maintenance cost - $ 0.4 per mile
- Loading and unloading cost – negligible
- Assume 4 weeks per month
- The lease provider pays the insurance cost
- A truck can make only 2 round trips per week
What is the total monthly cost?
Question: What other ways can you suggest to make more money with this transportation system?
A good candidate will identify the opportunity to make use of the empty-return truck from Denver to
Chicago. They may suggest transporting any raw materials or sell the space to some other trucking
company.
Question: What are the negatives of leasing trucks?
- Managing the drivers
- What if the vehicle meets with an accident?
- We have to maintain accounting systems for all the expenses.
Question: Will this system ensure reliable delivery?
Ask the candidate to provide a 30 second summary of his recommendation.","Current system by using Freight Company:
Monthly demand = 4 * 40 = 160 truck loads
Total miles traveled = 160 * 1000 = 160000 (Freight companies charge only one way)
Total cost = 160000 * $3 per mile = $ 480,000
New system with leasing:
Weekly demand = 40 truck loads. We need 20 trucks as a truck can make only 2 round trips a week
Leasing charges per month = 20 trucks * 1750 per month = $ 35,000
Labor cost per month = 20 trucks * 16000 miles per truck per month * 0.5 = $ 1,60,000 (Here an
empty truck returns from Denver to Chicago after making a delivery to the customer and for each
delivery a truck travels 2000 miles. Thus in a month a truck travels 16000 miles)
Fuel cost per month = 20 * 16000 * 0.25 = $ 80,000
Vehicle maintenance cost = 20 * 16000 * 0.4 = $ 128,000
Total cost per month = 35000 + 160000 + 80000 + 128000 = $ 403,000
Expected saving = $ 480000 - $ 403000 = $ 77000 per month"
"Apollo Medical Labs
Your client is a chain of Medical laboratories. The labs cater to patients who need MRI, CT scans and
other major tests to be performed. The labs own several expensive testing equipments and there are
chain has currently about 200 such labs. Doctors usually refer the patients to these testing centers.
The client is now worried about the profits and has hired you to evaluate the situation.
Specific objectives: No specific targets
Instructions to the interviewer: There no specific profit targets. The idea is to see if the candidate
can generate as many reasons for potential sales decline, cost increase and price reduction. This way
we can you can test the candidate’s ‘Clock-Speed. ’Then later make the candidate go through a
bunch of Math to test his/her quantitative skills.
Suggested Structure: As mentioned above the candidate should address the following points
1) Why would sales be flat or going down? At least 7 reasons. If they don’t reach this limit, keep
asking ‘what else’. Once they reach move to the next point
2) Why may costs be going up? At least 7 reasons. If they don’t reach this limit, keep asking
‘what else’. Once they reach move to the next point
3) Why may price be going down or not increasing? At least 4 reasons. If they don’t reach this
limit, keep asking ‘what else’. Once they reach move to the next point
Quant question: In your analysis you find that some of the doctors who refer the patients to these
centers have started labs in their own clinics and this will impact the client’s revenues. Can you look
at the following table and find out the expected % impact on the client’s revenue

Data: Provide the following data only when asked
Fixed Cost of Equipment to start 1 lab $800,000
Average price charged per customer $500
Variable cost per customer $420
Life of the equipment in years 5
No.of days per year 250
Calculations: The calculations are shown below for the interviewer’s reference
A Fixed Cost of Equipment to start a lab $800,000
B Average price charged per customer $500
C Variable cost per customer $420
D Breakeven quantity (No.of customers) 10000 A/(B-C)
E Life of the equipment in years 5
F Customers per year 2000 D/E
G No.of days per year 250
H
Number of customers required per day to
break-even 8 F/G
Note: No discounting of cash flow is required when considering the revenues from
customers over a 5 year period
Thus only doctors who get at least 8 patients per day will be able to get a pay back within 5 years.
This means only doctors who get more than 8 patients per day will start their own labs and steal
revenue away from our client. So out of the total revenue of $ 300million (Add from graph) revenues
of about $ 12 million may be lost (6+6). This means about 4% loss of revenue.
Question: What can the client do to remedy this situation or how should the client respond to this
situation? Creative ideas win points here.","How to answer this?
Only doctors who can make profits by owning labs will be willing to invest in expensive lab
equipment. Intuitively doctors who get more patients per day will be able to make profits. So the
number of patients a doctor needs per day to ensure payback for the investment he/she makes has
to be calculated. The candidate has to figure this out. Only after the candidates crack this idea, give
the following information.

"Canada Oil Sands
The Canada Oil Sands company recently struck Oil Sands in Canada and are planning to build a
production and refining facility. The estimated cost of building a facility is $ 5 billion and estimated
time for completion is 5 years. The company is concerned about cost and time overrun to complete
the project. For your information, 5 other competitors have already started building production and
refining facility in the near by areas. You have been hired as a consultant to assess the situation and
make them aware of the potential issues.
Instruction to the interviewer: The objective of this case is
- To see if the candidate possesses a good clock speed i.e if the candidate quickly explores
several possible reasons for time and cost overruns
- To see if the candidate presents creative solutions to specific questions posed by the
interviewer and to see if the candidate can quick basic math
The case should start with the candidate hypothesizing the reasons that could lead to cost and time
over runs. To guide the candidate you may ask the candidate to list the possible steps in the project

Interviewer Notes: The case will now focus on the labor issues. Provide the following data to the
candidate
- The components are fabricated in another country, however joining the components and
installation take place on-site
- The peak demand for labor will occur in 3 years from now
- The period sadly coincides with the peak labor demand for competitors in the same region.
Especially we need several welders and we are quite sure that they can’t get welders.
Ask the candidate for some ideas to manage the situation. Some possible suggestions could be:
- Automation of construction, material movement, fabrication and welding of components
- Explore opportunities to get pre-welded components from supplier
- Design components in such a way so that the need for welding itself is reduced
- Share some facilities like piping, storage etc with competitors thereby eliminating the need
for separately building them
- Recruit labor from other countries (But cultural issues, immigration issues, opposition form
labor unions in Canada, not many want to move to Alberta, Canada as it is very cold)
- Recruit labor from US as there seems to be a decline in manufacturing industry and hence the
client may be able to obtain skilled welders
- Tie-up with technical training institutions and develop students from now onwards with a
guaranteed employment after 3 years
Interviewer Notes: It is time to make the candidate do some math. Tasks for the candidate
1) To calculate the breakeven number of barrels of crude and years to breakeven assuming no
over runs

Variable cost of refining per barrel of crude (Dollars) 13
Break- even quantity (Barrels) To be calculated by candidate
No.of years to break even (Assuming 330 days of operation) To be calculated by candidate

Instruction to the interviewer: Ask for a 30 second summary of the candidates findings.","Possible reasons: Cost over-runs
- Uncertainty or Changes in the field profile resulting in increased construction costs
- Changes in price of commodities like steel and other materials used for construction
- Environmental regulations resulting in additional investment
- Suppliers operating at full capacities resulting in additional investment. Hence the supplier
may ask the client to share some investment.
- Skilled labor shortage for construction resulting in very high salaries. This is the biggest
problem in this industry and the case will focus on this problem.

Possible reasons: Time over-runs
- Design and Field development planning delays
- Manufacturing lead time for machinery and equipments
- Transportation lead time for plant machinery and equipments
- Labor shortage during construction, installation and commissioning
- Poor productivity of untrained labor
- Government approvals and regulations
- Approval from environmental authorities

Costs of the program: Each gift costs the company $1. The customer gets one gift for each 200 points.
Instruction to the interviewer: Please read out the above data and don’t give it in the table format.
See how the candidate organizes his data.
The candidate is expected to calculate the following to justify his conclusion
- Absolute revenue increase and percentage revenue increase for the ‘Heavy’ segment
- Absolute revenue increase and percentage revenue increase for the ‘Light’ segment
- Total profits from the program
The calculations are shown in the below table
Heavy Light
A Total revenue without program 960000 432000
B Additional revenue with program 38400 7200
C % increase in revenue (B*100/A) 4.00% 1.67%
D Incremental income @ 20% of rev (B * 20%) 7680 1440
E Total points scored (A * 2) 1920000 864000
F Cost of gifts (E * 1/ 200) 9600 4320
G Net profit from the program (D Minus F) (1920) (2880)

Conclusion: The results show that the program is a losing proposition. Why – The cost is spread over
all the purchases and not just the incremental spending.
Instruction to the interviewer: If the candidate reaches this conclusion, ask for suggestions to make
this program profitable. Most candidates may not distinguish between profits from Light and Heavy
users. Hence ask if this can be implemented only for heavy segment. Candidates who get creative at
this stage will get more points. Some suggestions would be
- Negotiate with the gift vendor and negotiate a better price
- Increase the number of points needed for a gift (However the incremental benefits may also
change)
- Look at co-branded customer loyalty programs with other companies like airlines etc. This
way the cost can be shared and opportunities for revenue increase are more.
- Explore alternate ways of discriminating between light and heavy users
Instruction to the interviewer: The CEO of the company says that the analysis is good. However he
wants you give him advice to increase sales (ideas apart from the loyalty program). This question is to
see if the candidate can quickly think of various ways to increase sales. Creativity will win points here
A good candidate would use the following framework

New Customers – New Products New Customers – Current Products

Current Customers – New Products Current Customers – Current Products

Instruction to the interviewer: Ask the candidate to give a 30 second summary of his findings and his
recommendations.","Suggested Structure:
Step 1: Understand the features of the program
Step 2: What will be the incremental benefits to the company?
Step 3: What is the cost involved in this program?
Step 4: Do benefits exceed costs?

Other data: To be provided only when the candidate asks for it.
- Assume the above percentage of customers is a fair representation of revenues.
- The total monthly sale of gasoline in the gas station is 200,000 gallons of which 60% is regular
unleaded and 40% is premium unleaded.
- Average spending on branding is 2 cents per gallon
- Margin on one gallon of ‘Regular’ is 5 cents
- Margin on one gallon of ‘Premium’ is 7 cents

Conclusion: It is clear that investment in branding is a profitable proposition. Especially the return on
branding spend is higher for ‘Premium’ gasoline than for ‘Regular’ gasoline.
Risks: Ask the candidate for the potential risks with this approach of determining branding
effectiveness. Some answers could be
- This is based on a study at one retail station and may not be representative of all retailoutlets
- A customer may have a combination of reasons for buying and not necessarily just one reason
- Though this seems to be a profitable proposition on an absolute scale, the ROI can be higher on
some other initiative on a relative scale","Suggested Structure:
This type of case is usually not given to candidates. The idea is to see if the candidate can quickly
come up with a structure. The candidate may want to first explore ways in which results of branding
campaign can be measured. Some ways could be
- Conduct a branding campaign and see if there is increased sales during that period
- Mine past data when branding campaigns were undertaken, perform statistical modeling and
measure the ‘Advertisement elasticity of demand’
- Measure ‘Brand Recall’
- Select a few retail outlets and conduct a consumer survey. Find out what percentage of Power’s
customers go their gas stations because of brand perception and loyalty.
In this case, we will use the last approach as we are trying to measure the overall benefits. The
investment in branding is continual and not limited to occasional campaigns. Guide the candidate to
this if he/she doesn’t get there soon. Assume that we will do the consumer study at only one retail
outlet.

Calculations to be done by the candidate: All on a per retail outlet basis
Monthly gasoline sales in the outlet (Gallons) 200000
Cost of branding - Dollars Per gallon 0.02
Type of gasoline Regular Premium
% of type of gasoline 60% 40%
% of revenues because of branding 35% 50%
Gasoline sold because of branding (Gallons) 42000 40000
Margins per gallon excluding branding expenses ($) 0.1 0.15
Total margin contribution due to branding ($) 4200 6000
Total cost of branding ($) 2400 1600
Net monthly profits from branding ($) 1800 4400
If the company had 5000 gas stations across the country then the total profits from the branding
spend is = 5000 * (1800 + 4400) * 12 months = $372 million per year"
"Rainbow Chemicals
Rainbow Chemicals recently emerged from Bankruptcy. They hired you as a consultant to help them
chart a future course of action. And first they want you to evaluate if the current products are viable.
How would you go about this?
Instruction to Interviewer: The case tests how a candidate thinks about the fundamentals of turning
a company around. For this the candidate has to understand the current situation first.

What led to bankruptcy? Simple the company was not making money and was incurring losses. This
led to default of loans and resulted in Bankruptcy. They refinanced the company through some
means and have very limited funding. Additional funding is not possible.
Products and Industry:
- Their main product is Chemical X and the by-product is Chemical Y.
- Both products X & Y are commodities
- The chemical industry is highly cyclical and now it is at its peak
- The industry is highly competitive.
- Customers are large chemical companies
Product economics: Data to be given only when the candidate asks
Annual production capacity: Totally 500,000 tons
Price of Chemical X = $95 per ton
Price of Chemical Y = $75 per ton
The end product from the manufacturing process is a combination of X & Y. It has to be separated
into X & Y. Each ton of the end product they produce has X & Y in the ratio 1 : 1.5
The candidate has to perform the following calculations
Annual production volume in tons 500000
X in tons 200000
Y in tons 300000
Price of X Per ton 95
Price of Y Per ton 75
Fixed Cost in $ 25000000
Variable cost per ton (X&Y) 60
Annual Revenue 41500000
Total annual cost 55000000
Net Annual Profit (13500000)

Instructions to the Interviewer: It is clear that the current products are making losses. Provide the
following response for questions that may arise
- Can we raise prices? – No we cannot. Industry is very competitive and also is at the peak of its
cyclical. This means that going forward that the price will only go down
- Can we exit the business? – It is a possibility. But push the candidate to look at ideas to turn
the company around
Question: How can we increase the top line?
Assume that both chemical X & Y have a saturated market and the market has several competitors.
With the cyclical demand and a downward trend expected in the future it is difficult to sell more. So
the candidate has to look for opportunities to launch new products or services
Question: What new products or services can the company launch?
Allow the candidate to explore options creatively. However funding to invest is very limited. Some
suggestions
- Products that can be manufactured without major modifications to existing plant set up. And
look for products that will hedge against cyclical business issues.
- Products that can be bought from manufacturers outside the US but can be sold in US
- Start a chemical distribution company
- Start a chemical research laboratory and provide R&D advice to other companies
- Ex: if the chemical is used in the coolant systems of machines then the customers would like if
the manufacturer administers the chemical into the system on a routine basis. The client can
look at any such opportunities
- Move into retailing chemicals
Question: It is obvious that the cost of production is higher than the price they can command. What
are the areas they should look at? Some suggestions
- Improve plant efficiency
- Reduce raw material cost by changing suppliers or negotiating costs down
- Reduce the fixed costs like corporate workforce and so on
- Outsource manufacturing to low cost countries
- Reduce energy costs by improving the energy efficiency
Question: Why can the client not exit the business? Sell this business to some one and start
something that is profitable? What issues do you foresee if you have to do so?
- Who will buy this business?
- How much can we sell this for?
- Issues with laying off several people
Instructions to the Interviewer: Ask for final recommendations.","Suggested structure: Overall the candidate should explore if the client can generate positive cash
flow in the future. If not the candidate should look at options to generate cash flow.
Step 1: Understand what led to bankruptcy
Step 2: Understand the products and industry
Step 3: Understand the current product economics and future projections
Step 4: Propose recommendations – Both for top line and bottom line improvement"
"Home Improvement Retailer
A home improvement retailer in the US has just entered the installation services business. Their staff
would go to the customer’s location for an additional fee and install the products bought at their
retail shops. Currently the company has revenues of about $10 billion and the company had
previously grown through some key acquisitions. Revenues are expected to grow at 10% every year.
They want their home installation services to be 20% of their revenues in 5 years from now. To
expand they are considering three options – Internally build capabilities by hiring people, start
Franchises, Acquire other installation companies. What should they do to expand? You don’t have
any other data or information.","Suggested Structure:
The case tests a candidate for clock speed and intuition without major scope for data crunching.
Step 1: Calculate how big the installation business should be in 5 years
Step 2: Decide on criteria to compare among the three options
Step 3: Come up with qualitative pros and cons of each option with regards to each criterion decided
Step 4: Propose recommendation
Solution:
Step 1: How big the installation business should be in 5 years?
Year Total Revenue in $b
Yr 0 10
Yr 1 11
Yr 2 12.1
Yr 3 13.31
Yr 4 14.64
Yr 5 16.11
So 20% of $16.11 b is approximately $3.2 billion dollars. This is a big number and is not an easy task.
The insight is that if this has to happen within 5 years then the expansion has to be rapid.
Step 2: The candidate can come with any number of criteria for comparison. Some suggestions are
- Capital investment
- Market share
- Margins
- Cultural fit
- Entrepreneurial spirit
- Control of employees
- Customer relationship
- Training the employees and Learning curve
- Consistency of business processes
- Integration of IT systems
- Exit risk

Step 4: Recommendation
From above analysis, each option has both pros and cons. The interviewer actually said the company
went in for the acquisition strategy given their previous experience and the need to quickly expand
to prevent competitors from gaining advantage.
Any recommendation is agreeable but the candidate should be able to defend it with strong logic"
"Airlines Catering
After the September 11, 2001 incident, air travel in the US declined to unforeseen levels and most of
the airlines were looking at all possible ways to cut costs. Our client is an airline which had cut the
free meal provided to passengers. It is year 2003 and now the client wants to introduce retail sales of
meals, beverages and snacks on the plane for which the passengers will pay. The client has not
thought through any of the options, risks and opportunities and have called you at the very thought
of this introduction. To introduce this, what are your considerations from an operational
perspective?
Clarification: Most candidates start evaluating the benefits and costs of this initiative with the
objective of giving a ‘Go’ or a ‘No Go’ to the proposal. Please emphasize that the decision to ‘Go’ has
been made and the candidate has to look at operational considerations.

Material flow: Some of the questions that need to be answered
- What items to be sold? Meals, beverages, Packaged foods, snacks
- Where to buy them? Or should the airlines start a kitchen and food be made in-house? If it
goes for only snacks then they can just buy it from the major retailers.
- How much inventory to maintain in the flight for each item? What is the distribution system
till it reaches the plane?
- How to maintain the freshness of food? Certain food types will have to be disposed if
freshness is lost.
- What type of food to be sold in each type of flight like long-haul, short haul, point to point etc.
Cash flow: If items are to be sold then money needs to be collected
- Will the passengers pay in cash or credit or debit card etc.
- If they pay by credit card how to establish connectivity? And what equipments are required
for that?
- How to make the connectivity very reliable?
- How will the collected money reach the accounting department?
Information flow:
- The quantity of inventory has to change according to the number of passengers traveling.
How will the passenger related information be integrated with the procurement function?
- How and at what frequency will the details of money collected be entered into the accounting
systems of the company?

- What systems will be in place to monitor the inventory levels at their distribution centers or
at warehouse?
People and their capabilities:
- Do we have enough staff on board to serve the customers?
- How do we train the staff on board to handling inventory and cash?
- When will the staff take orders from passengers – Before take-off or ‘on-need basis? How
many selling trips will the staff make in the cabin?
- Who will be primarily responsible for managing inventory and cash?
Summary: Ask the candidate to summarize the key points in 30 seconds.","Suggested structure:
Operationally the following things are important
- Material flow
- Cash flow
- Information flow
- People and their capabilities"
"Strong Steel Company
Strong Steel Co. is a large European steel manufacturing with annual revenues of $6.3B and
operating profits of $650M. The company operates integrated mills. Their competitors in Europe are
10 other integrated mills (IM’s), using 150 year old blast furnace technology and 30 mini-mills (MM’s),
all of which are smaller than the IM’s; they use most modern technology, a method commercialized
during 1970’s. A process flow diagram for both the technologies and the end product of each stage is
given below.

Question: Ask the candidate what he/she can understand from the flow diagram. (Guide if they don’t
get there soon)

Main Case Question: A new steel commodity exchange is under development in the European Union.
The company will be able to buy and sell commodity steel (hot rolls) on the exchange. With the
opening of the online exchange, should Strong Steel Co. continue to make its own commodity steel
or should it buy commodity steel?
Additional information: If they decide to exit the production of commodity steel (hot rolls) and
decide to buy from exchange, the bought steel will be used as inputs for manufacturing value added
steel.

Data: Provide the following data about Strong Steel to the candidate when asked.

Total 6555.0 5975.0 580.0 100.00% 100.00%

Key conclusion from the calculations: The profits and revenues contributed by commodity steel is
significant to Strong Steel.
Additional data: To produce commodity steel the operating costs for mini-mills is $220 per ton
Key conclusion: It is highly likely that the price of commodity steel on the exchange will drop below
$260 which is the variable cost per ton for integrated steel manufacturers. This means that our client
will make losses
How much should be the minimum saving from the ‘Buy’ decision so that we can maintain the same
profits as now? (The steel bought will be used as inputs to the value added steel)","Answer: Only the melting process is different. All others are same. The basic product (hot roll) feeds
the upstream stage, gaining value at each stage.

How to solve this case? Let us use the hypothesis driven problem-solving method. Say the
hypothesis here is ‘Strong Steel should buy commodity steel from the exchange’. To prove this we
need to answer the questions shown in the box below.

Strong Steel should buy commodity
steel from the exchange

• How much revenue and profit currently
comes from commodity steel?
• How much would the company need to save
by buying commodity steel on an exchange
to make up for profit lost by not making it?

• What are Steel Co’s production costs
compared to mini mills?
• What will the market price for commodity
steel be?
- Candidate has to make assumptions

Savings from buying on commodity market
will be more than profit lost from
abandoning commodity steel production

Strong Steel Co’s cost disadvantage in
commodity steel will make this an
unprofitable business

Calculations to be performed by candidate:
Profits that the client will give up = $ 195 million
Number of tons produced after exiting commodity steel = 8000 tons (Only value added =
5000+2000+1000)
To keep the same profits extra savings needed = 195,000,000 / 8000 = $ 24.375 per ton
Buying commodity steel in the exchange should result in at least $ 24 to $25 per ton saving keep the
same profits.
Recommendations: The numbers and environment suggest that Strong Steel should exit commodity
steel production and start buying from the exchange. Ask the candidates for the risks of such a
decision to exit
- Union and labor issues from laying off labor
- Pressure from the government
- Loss of control on quality of steel
- Competitive weakness
- Subject to fluctuations in the market price"
"DVD rental store
A regional video rental chain is facing declining profits for the past 2 years. You are hired to identify
the root cause and make suggestions to reverse the trend
Suggested Structure:
This is a straight Revenue and Costs case. Test the candidate for various hypotheses and math skills.
Step 1: The candidate has to identify sources of revenue. Then he has to propose various hypotheses
possible for a decline in sales volume. (At least 5 to 7 hypotheses)
Step 2: Candidate may want to look at pricing and pricing arrangements. Then he has to propose
various hypotheses possible for a decline in prices.
Step 3: The candidate has to identify sources of cost. Then he has to propose various hypotheses
possible for a decline in revenue. (At least 5 to 7 hypotheses)
Sources of revenue: The main source of revenue is the rental fee collected. The other source of
revenue could be late fees. Though the company doesn’t sell DVDs some candidates may mention
this. Some hypotheses for sales decline
- Increase in rental fee
- Long waiting list and stock outs due to improper inventory management
- Deterioration of customer service levels
- Increase in late fees
- Entry of competition like Netflix or new competitor stores
- Overall industry decline (Less new movies being made)
- Substitute products like Video-On-Demand and direct streaming of video to PC
- Increase in pirated DVD market
- Cut in advertisement spend and budget resulting in poor publicity
- Store locations in key markets changed to reduce cost
Ask: The candidate may also want to monitor changes in metrics like Same-store sales, Sales per
square feet, Number of customer visits per store, Revenue per customer, New store sales, Sales by
geographic region etc. Ask the candidate for the metrics he would like to explore. We don’t provide
any data here but the idea is to see how the candidate thinks.
Pricing arrangements: The revenue is captured through pricing. Ask the candidate for different
methods of pricing for a DVD rental business
- Fixed monthly fee
- Fee for DVD based on number days of use (Example: $2 per movie per day or $ 5 per movie
per week)
- Price discrimination (lower price for members and higher price for non-members)
- Pricing based on ‘On-time DVD return record’
- Pricing of late fee (Penalty increases with each day the DVD is not returned back)
- Different price for new and old movies
- Student discounts
- Additional fee for value added services like home delivery, home pickup etc

Price can go down for several reasons. But mainly the candidate should touch upon pricing pressure
from competition and substitute products.
Sources of cost: For a DVD rental chain some of the costs could be
- Store rental charges (Real estate)
- Cost of DVDs
- Some times the movie distributors have a revenue sharing agreement with the chains
- Labor cost
- Store maintenance costs like energy, utilities, insurance and so on
- Advertisement and promotion costs
- Damaged and lost DVD costs (Includes shrinkage and non-returned items)
- Corporate over heads
- Taxes to government
Increase in the above costs could have resulted in a profit decline. It is a good idea to group the costs
as internal and external costs. The other way to group it would be fixed and variable costs.
Testing the Quant Skills:
Provide this information to the candidate – ‘Based on our analysis we find that there has been an
increase in the labor costs in the last 2 years. We also find that a high percentage of customers don’t
return the DVDs on time. As the company currently doesn’t have any late fee this is resulting in stock
outs and customer defection. So the company wants to introduce a ‘Late fee’ program. You have to
do 2 things now
- Quantify the impact of the increase in labor costs
- Recommend if the company should go ahead with the ‘Late fee’ program
Impact of increase in labor costs: Provide the following data to the candidate.
Number of stores 300
% of stores affected by labor cost increase 16.667%
Store working hours per day 12
Annual working days 250
Number of workers per store at any given time of day 4
Labor cost per hr per worker (Before cost increase) $9
Labor cost per hr per worker (After cost increase) $12

The increase in labor cost is approximately $1.8 million
Should they implement the ‘Late fee’ program?

The candidate will have to explore the benefits and costs of the late fee program. Provide the
following data only when requested by the candidate
Number of stores 300
Annual working days 250
Number of customers per checking out per day per store 100
Average number of DVDs a customer checks out per visit 2
Maximum number of days a customer can keep DVD (as per policy) 3
Fee per DVD (All customers pay this amount irrespective of number of
days they keep this) $6
% of customers who return DVDs later than due date 10%
Average number of late days 2
Late fee proposed per DVD per day $1
% of current revenue lost because of late fee introduction (Assume this
make some customers choose another competitor who offers no late
fee) 8%

Question:

1) Ask the candidate for ways to reduce labor cost
2) Ask for alternative ways to ensure timely collection of DVDs back without late fee

Look for creative answers","Calculations to be performed by the candidate:
Total number of man hours per year per store 12000
Total number of stores affected by labor increase 50
Total man hours per year in affected stores 600000
Total annual labor cost in the affected stores before the cost increase $5,400,000
Total annual labor cost in the affected stores before the cost increase $7,200,000
Total increase in costs $1,800,000

Calculations to be performed by the candidate:
Current revenue $90,000,000
Expected late fee collection (Treat this as revenue) $3,000,000
Revenue lost because of late fee collection $7,200,000
Net revenue from this initiative ($4,200,000)
Numbers show that the ‘Late fee’ program will result in a net loss of revenues. Probably they should
not go ahead with this program."
"Flying-bird Airlines is an airline in the middle-east that serves Africa and Australia. They are a small
company with a fleet of just 25 aircrafts. Company performance is mediocre and the CEO of the
company is looking for opportunities to improve the profits. The company doesn’t have funds or
avenues for obtaining funds to buy planes or make major investments in the immediate future. How
would you approach this situation?
Instructions to interviewer:
This is a Straight Profits = (Price * Volume – Costs) case. Guide the candidate to start with ways to
improve revenues.
Question: How can they increase revenues? At least 5 hypotheses
Question: The CEO of Flying Bird Airlines is interested in entering into a partnership with a major
airline that flies to the same destinations. The CEO wants recommendations on what they should
consider when determining if they should enter into the alliance.
- What will be the benefits from this alliance?
- On what basis will the revenues be shared?
- How to share costs? – Costs like advertising and so on
- Will there be any issues to the brand image and positioning? (ex: a low cost airline wouldn’t
want to have an alliance with a premium airline)
- Are there cultural differences between the employees of the airline companies (The staff of
both airlines need to co-operate on a daily basis to make this work and cultural differences
would lead to issues)
- How to integrate the IT systems? Are they compatible?
Question: The alliance is expected to improve the load factor of the planes. (If the candidate asks for
the definition of load factor, please say ‘Load factor is defined as the ratio of actual number of
passengers in a plane to the total number of seats in a plane’) Calculate the current profits per plane
per flight. Give the following information to the candidate:
Average flight of a plane = 1000 miles
Seats per plane = 250
Fixed cost per plane per flight = $20,000
Revenues = $0.25 per passenger per flight mile
Other costs = $0.10 per seat per mile (not per passenger)
Provide information about current load factor only if the candidate asks for it.
Current load factor = 80%
The candidate is expected to perform the following calculations first.
Revenue per plane per flight = 80% * 250 * 1000 * 0.25 = $50,000
Profits per plane per flight = 50,000 – Fixed cost per flight – Variable cost per flight

= 50000 – 20000 – 0.10 * 250 * 1000 = $5000

Question: Now if the alliance would lead to a 50% increase in profits per flight, how much will the
load factor increase? Assume the other data given previously remain the same.
The candidate is expected to perform the following calculations first.
Post-alliance Profits per plane per flight = 1.50 * 5000 = $7500
Also profits per plane per flight

= (Load factor * 250 * 1000 * 0.25) – (20000 + 0.10 * 250 * 1000) = $ 7500

Therefore the new load factor per flight = 84%. The other way to interpret this is, ‘If the load factor
increases from 80% to 84% the profit per flight will increase by 50%’
Question: The CEO also wants to know what areas to attack to reduce costs and needs some quick
suggestions?
- Hedge fuel
- Eliminate routes or schedules with very low load factor
- Outsource aircraft maintenance
- Introduce technology and automation to reduce labor costs
- Outsource or offshore ticketing, customer support, billing, rewards and related functions
- Explore options to flying into airports where the gate costs may be cheaper","Question: How can they increase revenues? At least 5 hypotheses – Some suggestions are
- Advertising
- Better customer segmentation and promotions tuned to the needs of different segments
- Analyze the routes and schedules. Then look at possibilities to change routes and schedules to
attract more passengers
- Develop a demand curve for each flight and work around pricing to attract more passengers
(Yield management)
- Study all the points of customer interaction and explore opportunities to improve customer
service (If candidate talks about this you may ask for examples)
- Join an existing alliance or partner with other airlines.
- Restructure the sales force to improve ticket sales effectiveness (Align their incentives,
increase their selling time, establish key account managers and so on)
- Work on the frequent flyer program (if any) and improve the program to retain customers.
Look at aspects like co-branding etc. Also may also want to look at miles and revenues as
against only miles while rewarding passengers.
- Start in-flight sales of various items (food, gifts etc)
- Introduce vacation packages
- Enter into cargo transportation (if possible)

Question: Now if the alliance would lead to a 50% increase in profits per flight, how much will the
load factor increase? Assume the other data given previously remain the same.
The candidate is expected to perform the following calculations first.
Post-alliance Profits per plane per flight = 1.50 * 5000 = $7500
Also profits per plane per flight

= (Load factor * 250 * 1000 * 0.25) – (20000 + 0.10 * 250 * 1000) = $ 7500

Therefore the new load factor per flight = 84%. The other way to interpret this is, ‘If the load factor
increases from 80% to 84% the profit per flight will increase by 50%’"
"Rental car company acquisition
Your client is a BIG-3 car manufacturer from the US. The client is interested in acquiring a leading
rental car agency in the US. What key questions you will answer to help the client make a decision.
And is this acquisition a good idea?

Instructions to the interviewer: Guide the discussion on the operating synergies. What are the
possible operating synergies and negatives of the acquisition? A good candidate will at least mention
2 synergies and 2 negatives.
Revenue synergies:
- The rental car company will be an assured customer and this will help the client boost their
sales and improve market share
- If the rental care company has strong presence in international markets, this will help the
client to expand and establish a strong foothold in the international market.
- More frequently the customers rent client’s car more likely they will buy cars sold by the
client in the future (for personal use). This can induce customer demand for our client’s cars
- Gives the client an opportunity to rent new model cars and induce demand
- Gives the opportunity to stay closely in touch with the customer and understand their
requirements and make quick changes if needed. Also this helps in generating ideas for new
product development
Cost synergies:
- Reduction of corporate, administrative costs and overhead
- Both companies have a claims processing division and can be merged to reduce cost
Potential risks:
- How will the other rental car companies react to this? What if other rental car companies
refuse to buy our cars?
- What if competitors stop supplying their cars to our target?","Structure: The candidate should disaggregate the problem into the following steps
- What is the objective behind the acquisition?
- How is the target performing as a stand alone company? Its company growth rate, profits,
industry growth...
- What are the synergies between our client and the target?
o Operational synergies
o Financial synergies
o Can the target be disciplined and improved?
- What are the risks in this acquisition?
- Is there a cultural fit between the client company and the target?
- Is there a competitive bid? Will the client have more synergies than if the competitor acquires
the target?
- The financial details of the acquisition - How much is the client going to pay and do they have
the source for funding the acquisition?
- Do the managers executing this deal from the client side have experience in deal making and
post-merger integration? Else do they need training or special inputs?"
"Automotive Parts – Make vs Buy
Our client, a global automobile manufacturer has been losing money for several years in its North
American division. The new CEO suspects a big reason may be his company’s high degree of vertical
integration. This client makes about 70% of its own parts, compared to 30-50% at its chief
competitors. The CEO has asked us to develop a cost saving strategy around this issue
Instructions to the interviewer: This case tests the candidate’s ability to develop a framework to
solve the problem rather than the candidate’s ability to crunch numbers. Most A.T.Kearney cases we
have seen are like this. And this case is a great example for how to arrive at hypothesis.
Background information (available if asked for)
- The client spends 35% of its North American revenues on its parts-making operations
- It buys (sources) another 10% from independent suppliers, most but not all of which are located
in North America
- Its parts-making operations are spread over six divisions and cover about 100 plants in the U.S.
and Canada. The same parts are often made in several plants
- All the plants are union, with high labor costs and generally average (often poor) quality
- Top UAW executives are split over issue of “give backs” — reducing labor rates, benefits,
retirement perks, etc., in return for fewer layoffs. Some union execs want to work with the new
CEO, others want to show him how strong the union is
- There is excess capacity in our client’s parts manufacturing plants, as well as throughout the auto
parts supplier industry
- Auto parts suppliers would be eager to win business from our client because it would reduce
their dependency on the other two U.S. auto manufacturers","How to approach the problem? – Great example of hypothesis driven problem solving
- First question
o “Given the situation, what is the key hypothesis? How would you state it?”
o Note to interviewers: a strong hypothesis is a testable statement that, if true, has
significant implications for the client
o Expected answers should be something like:
 “The client could save $X millions by making only those parts where it has a
competitive advantage or a strategic requirement (i.e., to be in the business of
making a certain part)”

- Second question
o “Let’s assume for the moment that your hypothesis proves to be true. What are the
significant implications to our client?”
o Listen for the soundness of the candidate’s logic, or for the creativity/intuition she uses
to answer this question

Third question

o “Let’s assume the hypothesis is as follows: The client could save $X millions by making
only those parts where it has a competitive advantage or a strategic requirement”
o “How would you go about testing this hypothesis?”
o Note to interviewers: this is the same as asking for a basic framework or work plan —
what are the key issues that need to be resolved? How are you going to resolve them?
o Stay at the “big picture” level — no need for details here

At a minimum, frameworks should cover these key points:
- Comparative costs
o What it costs our client to make the parts, versus what it would cost to buy them from
independent suppliers

- Strategic value
o What strategic value is there to making certain parts, even though they could be
purchased for less than it costs to make them, e.g., batteries for electric vehicles

So a good framework might be:

Better frameworks would incorporate some of these features:

o Would this be practical?
o Include union and client managers on the study team to promote buy-in of the results
o Benchmark the client’s North American parts manufacturing plants
 Against themselves to show “best current capabilities”
o Against other firms’ auto parts manufacturing plants
o Get quotes from potential suppliers around the world for a broad cross-section of
parts to establish market prices
o Interview the client’s R&D, design and engineering managers to determine which
parts are strategically important and why
o Given the excess capacity in the industry, assess the opportunity for further cost
savings by consolidating parts currently made in several plants into a single plant
o Analyze the cost chain and cost drivers of parts manufacturing. This would lead to the
importance of standardization of parts across platforms, and economies of scale"
"Dry cleaning business entry
A large consumer package goods company (say Proctor and Gamble) wants to enter the Clothes
washing and dry cleaning business in US. They want to set up a chain of retail shops that will offer
washing and dry cleaning services to consumers. They would want about $1 billion annual revenues
and 10% operating profits from this business in 3 years. They have hired your team to help them
make a decision. How would you go about it?
Instructions to interviewer: This case is more about understanding how the candidate thinks about
the problem. While many details were not provided in the interview, we have researched and made
the details available and made the problem tougher.

Details to be provided when asked:
- The laundry and dry cleaning industry will grow 10% in 3 years from now (About 3.25% per
year)
- The industry size in the US is about $9 billion. Of this 60% is retail full service shops, 20% is
industrial washing like uniform washing services and 20% is coin operated self-service.
- There are about 30000 retail stores in the US. About 80% of them are mom and pop stores
and the remaining are small chains
- The most common and most profitable form of dry-cleaning business is the “full plant”.
Companies that perform all of the processing on the premises. These firms often include
additional pick-up and drop-off points that provide the main plant with goods to dry-clean.
- P&G has some of the leading detergent brands in the US like Tide","Sample structure:
One way to look at it is to use Porter’s 5 forces but it is too common a framework that interviewers
don’t like it very much.
A simple but powerful way to look at is as follows
- The first step will be to see if there is sufficient demand for the service and if the client can
obtain a significant market share to generate required revenues
- Then even if there is sufficient demand, can they make the required profits
- Next, what capabilities does the client have to enter this business? Why can the client do this
business better than the other competitors?
- Is the new business aligned with the image and vision of the company?
- If the company decides to enter the business, what will be the mode of entry?

A good candidate will explore the following:
- How many stores should P&G open (or acquire) to achieve their revenue targets? However
acquisition is very difficult as the industry is very fragmented. Provide the following details for
calculation
o On average a store operates 300 days a year
o Each day they process about 0.1 tons of clothes
o And they charge about $6000 per ton of clothes
Upon calculating, P&G should open about 5500 stores in next 3 years to generate a $1 billion in
revenue. In 3 years the market size would be 1.1 times $5.4 billion and will be about $ 6 billion.
To generate $1 billion from this means capturing 16.67% of market share.
Is it possible to achieve that kind of a market share in 3 years given the fragmented and highly
competitive nature of the industry? Candidate should make a compelling argument indicating the
strengths and synergies that P&G can bring to make it happen (like branding, advertising,
marketing, promotions, technology, economies of scale, logistics and distribution)
- How will P&G be able to make 10% operating profits? For this provide the following details
and ask the candidate to calculate operating profits on a per store basis. This margin is the
current industry performance level
o Cost of labor = $7 per hour.
o 5 laborers per store and they work 8 hrs on average per day
o Cost of detergents, washing solvents = $2000 per ton of clothes
o Water, electricity and effluent treatment charges = 6.667% of revenues
o Annual rental for real estate = $15000
On calculations the profit equals $9000 which is 5% of revenues.
Thus leads to the question, ‘Will P&G generate 2 times the industry profit margins to get 10%
profits?’ In addition is this business in line with the vision of P&G to be the leading branded
Consumer Packaged Goods Company?
Answer: Typically 50% candidates say they P&G should enter this business and 50% say they
should not. More than the answer, the candidates thought process and ability to substantiate
their answer with confident arguments is important"
"Norway cement company expansion (Mini case)
This is the map of Norway. A major cement company would like to expand their geographic coverage
in Norway. What information would you need to know? Should they expand? And finally, where
should they expand?

Information to be provided when asked:
• We currently dominate the South part of the country. We have 60% market share in the
south. We have only one manufacturing facility which is in Oslo
• South constitutes 70% of the cement market and Central Norway constitutes 25%
• There is one other major competitor in the central region of the country. The competitor has
80% market share in that region.
• The population density of the country is high in the South, and sparse in the north.
• There is a new port planned to be constructed in the center of the country. It will require
more cement supply than the current competitor can handle.
• We have no special technology that is superior to any other competitor.
• Southern competitors are small and highly fragmented.

"Green Machine hybrid car pricing in Australia
Green Machine wants to launch an electric-hybrid (compact-sedan) in Australia. They want to know
how to price it? Your team has been hired to help them formulate at a pricing strategy.

Instructions to the interviewer: Each method has its own merits and de-merits. One has to use all
the methods to triangulate and arrive at a price range. Later bundling with features, skimming and
discrimination techniques can be used to realize healthy prices and profits.
Details to be provided when asked:
- Green machine is a domestic car manufacturer in Australia.
- The size of the Australian car market is about 700000 cars per year of which 80% is sedans
- The consumers are shifting more and more towards fuel efficient cars as the fuel price in
Australia is very high compared to many other countries
- There are currently no hybrid vehicles in the mainstream in Australia. However Toyota and
Honda are planning to launch hybrids in Australia in about 3 years
- Hybrid cars were introduced about 7 years back in the US. Toyota sells Prius at about $35000
and Honda sells Civic-hybrid at about $31000
- Green Machine hybrids drive 40 miles per gallon in the city and 33 miles per gallon on the
highway (Hybrids are actually more efficient in city driving than highway driving)
- Non-hybrid sedans average 20 mpg in city and 25 mpg on highways and they sell for about
$20000 to $23000
- An average Australian car owner drives 20000 miles with about 50% in-city driving and 50%
highway driving
- Hybrid cars have a higher maintenance cost – about $125 per year more than other cars
- Cost to manufacture a hybrid is about $20000. The additional distribution expenses are about
10% and Sales and Marketing expenses are an additional 15% of manufacturing cost.
- Average car owner keeps the car for 5 years. Cost per gallon on gasoline in Australia is $3.50
- Apart from waiving taxes, government is willing to give a $1000 subsidy per hybrid car sold
Value based pricing: The candidate has to identify the incremental value that the hybrid will provide
over the conventional sedans on a per car basis.
Calculations show that theoretically a customer will be willing to pay up to $5500 more per hybrid car
when compared to a non-hybrid car.

Calculations:

Incremental savings per car from using a hybrid

Hybrid Non-hybrid
Total miles driven by a owner/yr 20000 20000
Total city miles (50%) 10000 10000
Total highway miles (50%) 10000 10000
Mpg in city 40 20
Mpg on highways 33 25
Total gallons of gasoline on city/car/yr 250 500
Total gallons of gasoline on highway/car/yr 300 400
Cost per gallon of gasoline $3.50 $3.50
Total cost of gasoline/car/yr 1925 3150
Incremental maintenance costs for a hybrid/yr $125
Annual incremental saving from a hybrid car ($) / yr 1100
Total life of a car (yrs) 5
Total incremental savings per car over 5 years ($) 5500
The comparable non-hybrid cars are sold for anything between $20000 and $23000. The customer
will be willing to pay anywhere between $25500 and $28500. But the candidate needs to do a quick
check if this range is higher than the cost of making and selling the car.

Cost of a Hybrid Hybrid
Manufacturing cost 20000
Distribution cost (@ 10% of mfg cost) 2000
Sales and marketing cost (@15% of mfg cost) 3000
Government subsidy or credit (to be subtracted) 1000
Taxes 0
Total cost ($ per car) 24000
It appears that $25500 to $28500 is a reasonable price range.
Instructions to the interviewer: Once a candidate reaches this answer, you may push the candidate
to the next level. There is an opportunity to deploy ‘Skimming’ strategy and price the hybrid higher
than $28500. They may be some customers who are willing to pay more than $28500. People like car
collectors, environmentally conscious corporate companies, people who consider a hybrid as a status
symbol and so on. And given that no other competitor is planning to launch hybrids in the next 3
years suits this strategy well. The candidate gets extra points for thinking in these lines without
prompting from interviewer. Provide the following information to the candidate and ask to perform
the required calculations
In a consumer survey about 15000 consumers said they will pay $35000 for a hybrid within the next 3
years. 10000 consumers said they will pay $30000. And 25000 consumers said they will pay $27500
for a hybrid in the next 3 years. Now how should the client go about pricing it?","Sample structure: A product can be priced in 4 different ways
- Value based pricing
- Cost plus pricing
- Competitive pricing
- Pricing based on supply and demand

Candidate is expected to calculate the profit from hybrids in the next 3 years and then decide the
price.

Price ($ per car) 35000 30000 27500
Number of customers (Equal to number of cars sold)

20000 30000 55000
Total revenue 700,000,000 900,000,000 1,512,500,000
Cost 480,000,000 720,000,000 1,320,000,000
Total profits 220,000,000 180,000,000 192,500,000
From this it is very clear that the client should employ skimming strategy. Price it at $35000 and sell
20000 cars in the first 3 years. Then when competition is about to enter the client can slash prices
and attract the consumers who are willing to pay less for a hybrid."
"Hammer Jack – Home improvement retailer profitability
Company: Oliver Wyman (This was one of the Mercer practice cases on their website and is not
available anymore but very interesting. The case has been modified)
Your client ‘Hammer Jack’ is a home improvement retailer. They have a national presence and the
third largest in the US after Home Depot and Lowe’s. Their annual revenue is about $15 billion. Their
current operating margins are about 4%. They have been facing declining sales for the past 2 years.
How can you help them to increase sales? Your recommendation should help them increase sales by
at least $2 billion in the next 1 year and should help them improve margins to 5%

Sample structure:
This case has to be dealt in a very simple manner. If the sales is declining only in the last 2 years then
some ‘External’ or ‘Internal’ changes should have taken place. The challenge is to identify them.
Before that a few questions about declining sales will help focus on the right areas. For example
- Did the sales decline for all players in the industry or only for our client?
Only for our client
- Is sales declining across all stores or is it specific to any geography?
All stores and not geography specific
- Is the same store sale declining or is it declining in the newly opened stores?
Same store sales declining
- Did the sales decline in any particular quarter or month?
Decline has been more or less uniform across quarters. However it is showing an increasing
trend
- Is the decline specific to any particular set of products?
Across products
- Is the decline uniform across all customer segments or is it specific to any particular segment?

2006 revenues (in $b) 8 4.5 2.5 15

It is clear that the Do It Yourself segment revenues have been declining in the past 2 years. Ask the
candidate for his/her hypothesis on why this could be happening. Ask for at least 5-7 different
hypotheses. More the number of important hypothesis, more points candidate gets
Details to be provided: After exploring the possible causes tell the candidate that in a survey with the
customers it is found that the customer service levels at competitors stores has improved
significantly for small customers and the apparently this could be a major reason for customers
moving to competitors. Probably the company is focusing more on contractors who place bulk orders
and on professionals who have been shopping at Hammer Jack for several years and tend to be loyal
and are mainly price conscious. DIY customers don’t mind migrating to competitors and have a very
diverse set of service expectations.
How will the candidate confirm this? And what are the different areas of customer service that the
client can possibly look at?
The candidate should be able to give a list of things that the client should explore about
customer service levels for the DIY customers. For example
- Return policies
- Improve product availability
- Online ordering or over the phone ordering
- Customer loyalty programs
- Training for DIY customers
- Extend the store hours
- Home delivery
- Installation support
- Order online and do quick pick up at shop
- Train the staff to be polite to all customers irrespective of the value of purchase they make
- Introduce technology ex: self-service counters
- Open food counters at the shop

Question: Before presenting your recommendations to Hammer Jack, you should prioritize the
options and ensure that they can help the client achieve its sales and margins goal. Present the
following chart to the candidate and ask him to pick the top 4 actions

It is natural for candidate to jump the gun and add up numbers and select the initiatives based on
revenue alone. But the goal is also to increase overall margins to 5% after implementing these
recommendations. The following calculations explain it
Revenue now = $15 billion
Revenue next year after implementing recommendations should be = $17 billion
5% of 17 billion = 850 million
Current margins = 4% of 15 billion = 600 million
So the candidate has to choose those initiatives that will sum up to $2 billion incremental revenue
and at least (850 – 600) = 250 million dollar additional margins. So the candidate has to ask for
margins for each of these initiatives because the cost structure for each of these initiatives is
different. Provide margins % data only when asked

Initiative

Incremental
revenue
($ million)

Margins

Training Classes for customers on self
installation 800 10% 80
On call installation support 400 9% 36
Provide warranty support and insurance
for purchases 750 8% 60
It is clear that the 4 top initiatives should be
1. Training classes for customers
2. Free home delivery
3. Provide warranty support and insurance services for purchases
4. Introduce customer loyalty program

"Clicks Photography
Our client, a photography company, currently makes money by selling film and photo paper. They
have experienced declining profits over the past five years. We have determined that our client’s
declining profitability due to volume declines resulting from digital substitution. As a result, the client
is now considering a few new business ideas to enter digital photography. Our client has been
approached by Kmart in order to place “kiosks” within each of their stores. Kiosks are self-serve
stations that allow users to print their digital photos on the client’s paper. How do we evaluate the
attractiveness of this opportunity?

Suggested structure: Any new opportunity has to be profitable at least in the medium and long run.
The following questions should be answered to get there
Demand – What is the market demand for the digital photography printing services at K-Mart?
Profits – Even if there is good demand can the client turn profits?
Capabilities – What capabilities and resources does the client have to be successful in this business?
Risks – What are the potential risks of this agreement with K-Mart?
Step 1: Size the market opportunity - Estimate the potential demand for digital prints per year within
a single Kmart store as an example
Top down calculation:
• 1M people in Boston
- *10% are Kmart customers= 100K
- *10% of customers go to Kmart to do photo finishing = 10K
- *5% of these customers use a digital camera = 500 people
- *average person prints 100 digital photos per year = 50K prints

Bottom Up calculation:
• How many people go to a single Kmart per year?
- 2500 customers per day
- *350 days/yr = 875000 visits per year = 0.9 million approximately
• How many digital prints will this translate into?
- Average customer goes to Kmart ten times a year (0.9M/10) = 90K unique customers
- *10% of customers go to Kmart to do photo finishing = 9K
- *5% of these customers use a digital camera = 450 people
- *average person prints 100 digital photos per year = 45K prints
The market opportunity per K-Mart store per year is about 45-50K prints.
Step 2: Is the business profitable – Will it generate a good return on investment?
One of the simple ways to determine this is to calculate the break-even demand and compare it with
the potential market opportunity

Provide data to candidate:
- Initial investment per kiosk is $6000
- Average price per digital print is $0.50
- Fixed cost per kiosk per year is $5,000
- Average cost of photo paper per digital print is $0.10
- Cost of printing ink per 500 prints = $75
Breakeven calculations:
Revenue = Cost
0.5*Q = 5,000+ (0.25*Q)
0.25*Q = 5,000
Q = 20,000 prints
Payback calculations:
Assume the demand is 50000 prints per kiosk. Of that only 30,000 prints contribute to the profits
(20,000 breaks even). The margin per print is $0.25. The total profits per year per store are $7500.
The payback is less than 1 year
The client would have to believe that it could sell at least 20,000 prints in order to take this action.
Here the potential opportunity per year is greater than the breakeven quantity.
Step 3: Capabilities and resources
The candidate should think of what kind of resources and capabilities they need to be successful in
this business. Some questions to ask could be
- Client has to invest in photo printing machines at Kiosks. Do they have funds?
- Do they have enough production capacity to manufacture photo paper?
- Client will have to manage inventory of printing paper and ink at these Kiosks
- Client has to manage if any machine breaks down (or at least they are responsible for revenue loss)
- They need to work out the cash flow mechanism. Will the customers directly use their credit cards
when using the self-service kiosk or will use the kiosk and later pay to K-mart

Step 4: Potential risks and issues – Some examples
• What if the demand is not as high as expected? Should they do a pilot launch?
• What if the present printing technology becomes obsolete in the next few years?
• Will our alliance will KMART prevent us from partnering with other major retailers?
• What if the price per print crashes because of competition from other retailers?
• We are assuming average numbers to decide on this initiative. Should we be focusing only on
stores that have more than average customers?
• What if the customers use the Kiosk machine in an incorrect way resulting in machine
damage?","Suggested structure: Any new opportunity has to be profitable at least in the medium and long run.
The following questions should be answered to get there
Demand – What is the market demand for the digital photography printing services at K-Mart?
Profits – Even if there is good demand can the client turn profits?
Capabilities – What capabilities and resources does the client have to be successful in this business?
Risks – What are the potential risks of this agreement with K-Mart?
Step 1: Size the market opportunity - Estimate the potential demand for digital prints per year within
a single Kmart store as an example
Top down calculation:
• 1M people in Boston
- *10% are Kmart customers= 100K
- *10% of customers go to Kmart to do photo finishing = 10K
- *5% of these customers use a digital camera = 500 people
- *average person prints 100 digital photos per year = 50K prints

Bottom Up calculation:
• How many people go to a single Kmart per year?
- 2500 customers per day
- *350 days/yr = 875000 visits per year = 0.9 million approximately

"Athletic Shoe Manufacturer
The 3rd largest athletic shoe company in the US has hired your consulting firm to determine why its
profits are declining while the profits of its two competitors are growing.
Instructions to interviewer: This case was presented by Deloitte’s recruitment team in a case
practice workshop at one of the top business schools. This case is narrated in a highly interactive
style just to demonstrate how a relaxed approach can help a candidate.","• Candidate: Can I have a moment to think through this?
• Interviewer: Absolutely.
• Candidate: If profits are down, that’s got to be a function of either revenues decreasing or
costs increasing. Let’s focus on the cost side: are the client’s costs in line with those of its
competitors? For example, are their manufacturing costs similar? Do they manufacture and
assemble in low-cost offshore locations? What about selling and distribution costs? Is the
client spending too much on a dedicated sales force when its competitors use independent
reps? What about general and administrative expenses? Does the client have flashy office
space or overpaid executives?
• Narrator: This is much better! The candidate gets off to a good start by setting up the answer
effectively. The “revenues – costs = profits” equation is simple, but it provides a clear way to
proceed through the problem. It lets your interviewer know that you understand a basic
business relationship and that you have a plan for rooting out the answer. In addition, the
candidate is asking good questions – at least half the battle in consulting is knowing what
questions to ask.
• Interviewer: Those are all good questions. But the client’s costs all seem to be in line with
those of its competitors. Costs don’t seem to be the problem. What would you look at next?
• Candidate: If the cost side isn’t the problem, then I would look at revenues next. Are sales
declining?
• Narrator: The candidate takes the hint and moves on to revenues.
• Interviewer: Actually, yes, revenue is down 6% from last year, and projections show another
5% dip for the coming year. How would you go about figuring out why?
• Narrator: A pointed question from the candidate has brought forth more specific information
that will help in the consideration of the case. The interviewer’s answer means that the
candidate will have to dig deeper.
• Candidate: I would try to break sales apart into its relevant components: are sales of certain
shoe models declining disproportionately to others, for example?
• Narrator: The candidate might have talked about the two pieces that make up sales: price and
units. However, she chooses to break down the sales picture into different product
categories, which is also fine.
• Interviewer: Not really, most SKUs – shelf-keeping units equivalent to individual product styles
– are actually declining at a similar rate. What would you look at next?
• Narrator: Looks like another dead-end. But don’t get depressed – it just means that the
recruiter has ruled out another possible explanation and narrowed the candidate’s focus a
little further. We’re getting warmer.
• Candidate: If it’s not a few laggard shoes designs driving the downturn for this company, and
sales are just down overall, it looks more like people have just stopped buying their shoes,
period. We need to figure out why. Who are their biggest customers? What’s their target
demographic? Are they just not buying athletic shoes anymore?
• Narrator: Having checked a variety of possibilities, the candidate makes a preliminary
hypothesis and proposes some ways to check this insight. Even better, she proposes some
next steps for the inquiry.
• Interviewer: You’ve hit on the crux of the problem: the company isn’t sure who its customers
are anymore. Formerly, its biggest customers were serious athletes interested in high
performance shoes. But the company isn’t sure if that’s true anymore. That’s one of the
biggest pieces of value we provided for the company – we told them who is buying athletic
shoes. How would you go about getting that information?
• Narrator: The interviewer reveals that the candidate has hit on a key piece of the puzzle.
Without pausing for breath, the interviewer then checks the candidate’s ability to turn her
insight into action and her common sense.
• Candidate: Well frankly, I’d go to the mall! I’d stand outside Foot Locker and see who’s
buying athletic shoes, check what brand they’re buying, and maybe even ask them why. By
doing this, I’d be able to see that demographic group was buying the most athletic shoes and
whether they were buying our client’s shoes or not. If not, I’d try to draw conclusions as to
why not. In short, I’d try to segment the athletic shoes market, and figure out how to target
the most attractive segments.
• Narrator: The candidate uses a common sense approach here, which is really good. Not only
is her idea practical, it would be easy to implement and it would be relatively cheap to do.
She also shows that she fully understands what information she needs to collect. Not only
would she observe customer behavior, and ask them why, she’d also analyze the findings and
try to draw general implications from them.
• Interviewer: Well, that’s exactly what we did – we went to the mall. And our field research
showed that young adults in the 13- to 24-year old age group were buying 65% of all the
athletic shoes in the market we looked at. That makes them the first priority market segment
for our client. The next phase of this case is just beginning: we need to put together a plan to
target this demographic group specifically. Do you have any ideas?
• Narrator: Now the consultant is pushing into new territory, trying to see just how far this
candidate can take the analysis.
• Candidate: Well, it strikes me that the demographic you’ve described is less concerned with
high performance (the company’s current focus, you said) and more concerned with the
image of their shoes. Do they look cool? Would Michael Jordan wear them? That kind of
thing. I would recommend putting together a marketing and advertising campaign to really
pump up their image in the eyes of the young public.
• Narrator: This comment is based more on the candidate’s intuition and creative thinking, but
it shows that she fully grasps the nature of the problem.
• Interviewer: That sounds on track with what we’re thinking about..."

"Blockbuster Store
After you graduate from McCombs you want to start a Blockbuster video rental franchise. The store
should be opened within the US. How will you go about deciding the location for the store?","Sample Discussion:
Candidate: A step by step method can be deployed to arrive at some options.
Step 1: The store should be located in a city or town or suburb that has a large pool of the type of
customers we intend to target.
Step 2: Once we have a few options, we need to evaluate the competitive situation in those selected
areas.
Step 3: In areas we are sure we can compete, the cost of operation has to be considered. For
example: In some areas the real estate value can be high and some it can be low.
Step 4: Of the locations chosen, ones that can be accessed easily by the customers will be preferred.
The above steps will help one narrow down on very few choices from which the best location suited
to conducting business can be selected.
Interviewer: Great. So how would you decide what types of customers to target? What are the
different ways to segment customers?
Candidate: Customers can be segmented by age, gender, income levels, movie habits, occupation,
marital status, family size etc
Interviewer: What type of customers you would target?
Candidate: Well – people who have a lot of free time are the ones who will watch movies at home.
Typically these are housewives, students and people retired from work. Also kids watch animation
and cartoon movies a lot. Of these segments the ones that have more money at their disposal are the
ones who are likely to rent videos.
Interviewer: Let us say you have identified 10 such markets where there are a large number of
customers that you are looking for. What do you do next?
Candidate: I will try to find the number and type of competitors in those markets and also
understand their business model and service levels. That will help me understand who I can compete
with and who I cannot. Also it will help me understand the gaps in service levels which can be crucial
in the decision to open a store in a particular location.
Interviewer: What kind of gaps do you think may exist?
Candidate: Say the store is not easily accessible to many customers who may have to drive a long
distance to reach a rental store. Or a store could be small and stock only a few copies of new movies
resulting in waiting lists – This means the demand is more than supply and there is an opportunity for
a new store.
Interviewer: You also mentioned about cost of operations. Can you explain a bit more about that?
Candidate: The major costs in a retail set up are real estate costs, store maintenance costs, labor
costs, and promotion. These costs will have to lower. It is not necessary that I will choose the
locations with the lowest cost. The costs have to be optimum for the demand levels anticipated.
The case can build beyond this with more questions. But the interviewer was more interested in
understanding the candidate’s ability to break a simple problem down into simple steps without
putting pen to paper"
"Customer Service @WebAds Inc.
Strategy & Business Development

Your client WebAds Inc. is a technology company that is in the business of online advertising.
They generate revenue by placing ad links on websites of web content publishers such as the
Wall Street Journal's WSJ.com. WebAds currently has 500,000 clients who are grouped into
three tiers. [Provide data in the box if asked.]
Tier
% customers
Total Revenue
A
5%
$500M
B
15%
$300M
C
80%
$200M
WebAds recently implemented a program that optimized customer service for customers in Tier
A and resulted in increased revenue per publisher (customer) within that Tier by 20% (based
on initial data). The program involves a customer service representative looking at a customer
website and offering customized design recommendations for each publisher. How would you
think about rolling this out to the other two Tiers?

⚫ The return over the cost of capital should be similar across Tiers.
.Net and gross margins are similar across all Tiers
How might the Customer Service models differ across the 3 Tiers?
Think about the revenue per customer generated at each Tier (See Analysis below for
calculation). Human customer service reps invest more time in high value customers of
Tier A. Reps will spend less time in Tiers B and C and more automation will be used
given the large number of customers and low revenue per customer.
What budget would you estimate for the implementation to Tier B and Tier C?
The implementation budget for each Tier (since return on cost of capital is the same)
should be proportion to the total revenue in that segment. Implementation budgets
should be in a ratio as follows:
Tier B:
$300M
$500M
60% of A
$200M
Tier C:
=40% of A
$500M
Revenue per Customer in each Tier:
•
o Tier A:
$500M
$20,000
(5% x 500,000)
o Tier B:
$300M
= $4,000
o Tier C:
(15% x 500,000)
$200M
= $500
(80% x 500,000)
How much (What proportion) does WebAds spend on servicing each customer in the
different Tiers?
The amount in time or dollars spent on the service upgrade should be in proportion to
the revenue generated per customer in each Tier (since a uniform margin is maintained
across all Tiers). See analysis below for calculation of revenue per customer. The cost
to service each customer should be as follows:
4,000
Tier B:
=20% of A
20,000
Tier C:
500
20,000
= 2.5% of A
Which Tier would you chose for the next implementation of the optimized customer
service model? Why?
The next implementation should be done within Tier B. Tier B together with Tier A
accounts for 80% of all revenue and will therefore result in the largest lift through the
optimized revenue model. Since Tier C represents only 20% of sales, WebAds could
take the time to leverage further learnings from the implementation in Tier B before
rolling it out to Tier C. This is critical if WebAds finds that the increase in revenue in
Tier B is lower than the expected 20%.
How can WebAds implement the new program to improve performance in Tiers B & C
when service time/cost per customer in those Tiers is significantly less than in Tier A?
WebAds should identify a scalable service optimization solution by analyzing the
process used during the implementation in Tier A. The analysis should identify trends
along the vertical (up that customer Tier) and horizontal (similar customers across
Tiers) segments. Several opportunities for process improvement exist:
о Develop best practices for customer service representatives to more efficiently
identify the most common optimization opportunities in each vertical or horizontal
segment. This would help improve efficiency during the process.
o Identify optimization opportunities in Tier A that can be automated. Service in Tier
B is likely to be semi-automated and the service in Tier C is likely to be fully
automated.
。 Outsource parts of the process (especially the labor-intensive portions).
。 Charge a price for the program, if the redesign process increases traffic to the
publisher/customer website.",Summary of Findings for the CEO: The analysis showed that Revenue per Customer in Tier B is 1/5 of Tier A and Tier C is 1/40 of Tier A. ⚫ Recommend finding ways to automate and leverage experience from Tier A implementation to lower cost per customer in proportion with revenue per customer in each Tier. • Implement next in Tier B with a budget that is 60% of Tier A. It's very possible that reducing cost to 1/40 for Tier A for Tier C is not feasible without relying on full automation.

Annual Sales: $800 MM
⚫ Market Share: (Candidate can calculate this) -26%
⚫ Other information:
Products: The majority of their business is in producing private label or
exclusive lines for Home Depot, Lowe's and Wal-Mart. They are a lower-cost
producer of value products.
Competition 2: Uptown L&G
Annual Sales: $500 MM
⚫ Market Share: (Candidate can calculate this) -16%
Other information:
Products: Strong in grass seed segment.
о Region: Primarily in the South.
Retail Distribution Channels
75% of CPG sales are through Home Depot, Wal-Mart, and Lowe's
• Remaining 25% of sales are through what are called independent stores: hardware
stores, nursery centers, regional chain mass merchant stores, and grocery and drug
.
stores.
Do you have any information about product sales or trends at Home Depot?
While retail sales continue to be up slightly at Home Depot, wholesale sales have
been flat to declining because they had built up excessive inventory and are now
unloading that before purchasing more. This is expected to continue in 2008.
Do you have any information about product sales or trends at Lowe's?
Sales are increasing quickly at Lowe's, mostly following their store expansion and
also due to more of the client's products being sold there.
• Do you have any information about product sales or trends at Wal-Mart?
Sales at Wal-Mart are growing, but slower than the growth we estimate for the
overall market.
• Do you have any information about product sales or trends at Independent Retailers?
Sales at independents are growing, slightly, even though these outlets are losing
market share to Home Depot, Lowe's, and Wal-Mart overall. This growth is due to
the optimization of the go-to-market approach (selling direct to bigger accounts and
going to distributor in others, with a pay-for-performance incentive for distributors).
Product Customer
Consumers who buy the client's products are traditionally male, but increasingly
female or the purchases are influenced by females.
They are predominantly home owners.
Company: Downtown L&G
Annual Sales: $1.9 B
⚫ Market Share: 61%
Revenue: Has been increasing over the past few years.
Price: Increased for the first time in a few years on the premium product segment.
⚫ Volume: Total product sales have increased.
Costs:
Variable Costs: Have increased due to increases in raw material costs and
freight. Downtown L&G has been able to pass these along to the Premium
product.
Fixed Costs: Have stayed constant.
⚫ Distribution Regions: Stronger in the Northeast and Midwest because their core
products align with the climate and growing conditions in this region. Downtown L&G
has been expanding product line to offer products suited specifically for other regions
as well.
Advertising: Advertises significantly to educate consumers on the importance of the
product category.
⚫ Benefits due to scale: Bargaining power with retailers to influence on display and
promotion space. Savings due to efficiencies in supply chain.
. Products: Downtown L&G has two main segments.
•
.
a. Premium Products: This has been their core business for a while. Downtown
L&G is known as a high quality producer and leads the industry in innovation.
b. Private Label Products: Downtown L&G recently launched a number of new
private label or exclusive products at the request of retailers. (If asked what a
Private Label is, it is a store branded product.)
Has the Private Label product cannibalized the Premium product?
No it hasn't.
How has volume grown for the individual product lines?
The Private Label product has grown volume. Premium brand has stayed constant
and has not been cannibalized by Private Label.
Why sell Downtown L&G Private Label brands? (The Interviewer should present the
information below one bullet at a time; at that point the interviewee should challenge
that and ask for further rationalization which would prompt the interviewer to reveal
the next reason)
Downtown L&G makes private label brands because the retailers have
requested it, in order to differentiate themselves from their competitors and
reduce pricing pressure.
。 Downtown L&G wants to take existing business from competitors such as
Midtown L&G, and also prevent them from gaining new business in the
industry.
o Downtown L&G hopes to use these products to negotiate other benefits such as
additional control of the inventory process (with advance orders and better
forecasting. Downtown L&G can reduce costs for themselves as well as the
retailers. However, retailers are often reluctant to turn this over).
Do the Private Label and Premium Brand products share the same cost
structure/manufacturing processes?
No. The Private Label is sourced to a third party who is able to produce the
products at a much lower costs than Downtown L&G. This affects costs for the
Premium brand product because Downtown L&G frees up more excess capacity
and is unable to utilize supply chain efficiencies and scale economies.
⚫ Are margins the same across both product segments?
No. The Private Label products earn a lower margin than the premium products
because Downtown L&G has to give their clients, the retailers, a greater portion of
the margin.
• How are product sales teams structured? How are they incentivized?
Product sales teams are divided into client-specific business development teams,
and are incentivized on meeting aggressive top line growth targets (which are set
significantly above the product category market growth rate). Sales of the Private
Label products help the sales teams achieve these targets.

Case Takeaways:
• Interviewer Question: What is the source of declining profitability?
Top-line has been increased, while the overall product margin has decreased over
the years. This is the root cause of the decline in profitability.
• Interviewer Question: What can you say about Downtown L&G’s decision to enter the
Private Label product market?
When the benefits are quantified and considered against costs, Downtown L&G is
giving up more than they are gaining. This has been happening because they have
been introducing these lower margin private label or exclusive lines, with little real
justification.","Potential solutions to declining profitability:
o Change incentives for product sales teams to be weighted in terms of product margin.
o Require more rigorous study of the economics of private label/exclusive brand plays
before making the commitment to the customer—all “strategic” benefits should be
quantified
o There is an inevitable tradeoff between revenue growth and margin. Identify which is
more important, top-line growth for Wall Street or the ultimate bottom-line? Potentially
abandon private label business to restore margins.
Recommendations for Bonus Question: Increase top-line Revenue by:
o The client can leverage its strength in R&D to innovate in new areas such as effective
and budget-friendly organics
o The client can gain top line growth by encouraging more frequent usage of products"
"Wine in Boxes
Increase Profits

Our client is the CEO of an Australia-based winemaker that is the market leader in its country.
The company has two types of products: bottled wine and boxed wine. Recently, profits have
been decreasing, and the CEO believes that this is due to losses in the boxed wine division. We
need to assess the situation and provide a recommendation.
1) What factors should we consider to determine whether the boxed wine is a good business?
2) What is the profitability of each of the two divisions?
3) What is our recommendation?
Background (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)
■The company is currently losing money
Sales are split evenly between the two divisions
■ Bottled wine sells for Australian US$ 5 p/unit; Boxed wine sells for AUS$10 p/unit
Bottled wine contains 750ml; Boxed wine contains 3 liters
■
A plastic bag holds the wine inside the box
■Both products have an overhead of AUS$0.50 p/unit
■Raw material, consisting of grapes, costs AUS$2 for the bottled wine
■ Packaging costs AUSSI for both products, while other variables (distribution and labor)
are AUS$1 per bottle and AUS$2 per box.

■ How is revenue split between the products?
⚫ What types of costs do the products carry, and what are they?
■ What price is being charged for each product? To whom?
■ Who is the target customer of each product?
■ Are the same grapes being used for both products? Why?
Analysis (Calculations to be completed by interviewee.)
If the grape cost for bottles is AUS$2, for boxes it is AUS$8 (1:4 ratio)
Profit for bottles is AUS$1.5; boxes have a loss of AUS$0.5","The company should try to source grapes of lower cost for its boxed wine product line.
Although the current raw material cost ratio is 1:4 when comparing bottled wine against boxed
wine, the price ratio is only 1:2. We can assume that this is because the bottled line targets a
superior market segment, and boxes cater to businesses that sell wine in bulk. This is another
reason for not maintaining the same quality (and cost) of grapes for both product lines. If raw
material cost for boxed wine could be lowered, even slightly, the line would be profitable.

"Chemical Spill
New Business Model

Your client is a U.S. chemical manufacturer in the commodity chemicals business with single-
digit market share. It recently emerged from bankruptcy and has limited capital available. The
chemicals business is cyclical with pricing cycles of 7 years. The company is worried about
how it will survive 2008 when it hits the bottom of the pricing cycle. The question is how this
company can become sustainable, if at all possible.
The chemical manufacturer has hired you to develop a new business model, either through (1)
acquisition into a non-cyclical chemicals market, (2) the manufacture of new products and
services for customers, or (3) your own recommendations.

Competitors
The market is highly fragmented. A large number of competitors are either stand-alone or
small in size, or are a small division of a larger conglomerate. Acquisition is difficult because
of limited capital.
Customers
Customers are highly fragmented, each of them purchasing no more than 10% of the chemical
manufacturer's inventory annually.
Raw Materials
Your customer's raw material suppliers are increasingly turning to ""greener"" processes and
products without increasing their total capacity. This trend is significantly reducing the supply
of ""non-green"" raw materials which drives their cost up.
Infrastructure
Your client currently has 5 plants. 3 are performing well, one has been having problems of
quality consistency recently and one plant has been historically a bad performer in terms of
capacity utilization. All plants are over 10 years old and production is spread evenly over all
the plants. (none are at capacity)
Government
Government: Push from environmental groups has caused additional government taxes and
regulations on shipping to be enacted recently.
Products
The chemical manufacturer produces two chemicals: X and Y. Chemical Y is a by-product of
Chemical X with a weight ratio of x = 1.5y (each 1.5 ton of X manufactured results in the by-
production of 1 ton of Y).
2005 Prices per Ton
Chemical X
Chemical Y

$175
2005 Costs per Ton
Chemical X

2006 Prices per Ton

2006 Costs per Ton

The Manufacturer expects to sell 100% of the chemicals manufactured. All of its plants operate
below capacity; they currently manufacture 100,000 tons of Chemical X annually to meet the
market demand. The pricing changes are normal.
Profit margin should be calculated, in addition to the dollar margin derived from Chemical X
versus Chemical Y to determine if there is any advantage to changing the product mix.
In 2006, 100,000 tons of X are being manufactured at a profit of $5/ton, deriving a profit of
$500,000 for Chemical X. The manufacturing of X results in the by-production of 100,000/
1.5. i.e. around 66,667 tons of Chemical Y or 70,000 tons for rounding purposes. Since
Chemical Y is a byproduct of X, one can assume a corresponding cost of $0/ton. The client
should thereby derive a profit of $100 x 70,000 $7,000,000 for Chemical Y, and a total profit
of around $7,500,000 for both chemicals.
Comparatively, the company generated a profit of $100 x 100,000 $10,000,000 for Chemical
X in 2005, plus an additional $175 x 70,000 = $12,250,000 for Chemical Y. This amounts to at
total profit of 22,250,000 in 2005, and therefore a huge loss in profit. These results are
summarized in the following Tables:
2006 Volume (ton) Price/ton

100% $11,666,666.67
Total $21,666,666.67","This case is qualitative in nature and can take many directions.
Interviewee should first explore the root causes of the sales and profit cycles including the
following topics: Why are costs increasing? Why is there a reduction in supply of raw
materials and can it be addressed? Who are our customer's customers? Can the company pass
them raw material increases? What are the new government regulations by the FDA? How
efficient is manufacturing?
Interviewee should further review pros & cons of acquisition, joint venture, licensing, divesting
a plant or two, and organic growth through new products/services (preferably with a pricing
cycle opposite that of X and Y). The dimensions for evaluating each option should include
impact on sales/profit, ROI, risk, feasibility, and timing.
In addition to organic and inorganic growth, there seems to be opportunities to improve the
current business model. For example, since none of the plants operates at capacity and
Chemical Y can be sold at a higher price/margin than Chemical X in the upside part of the
pricing cycle, the interviewee may ask these questions:
⚫ Can the plants increase their production of X and Y when the pricing cycle is up? Are
there opportunities for cost reduction by increasing the volume of raw materials
purchased?
⚫ Can the more profitable chemical Y be produced in larger quantities in upside cycles?
Exploring the trend of raw materials suppliers turning to greener products:
If the suppliers of raw materials for X and Y are switching to ""greener"" processes
across the industry, can the client pass on the price increase along the value chain?
⚫ Can the client use this as an opportunity to differentiate its products as ""green"" as well
and therefore charge a premium?
Possible recommendation may include:
⚫ Launch new products & services to differentiate from the competition, build customer
loyalty, gain new customers, and leverage synergies through existing plants.
Operating costs may increase with purchase of new materials/machinery for refining
chemicals.
⚫ Organic growth must be considered in addition to improving the client's current
business model which does not seem to be working well.
⚫ Possible exploration into joint ventures or divesting the company.
Any number of recommendations would work for this case as long as the interviewee properly
explores all of the options."
"Arbitrage!!
Labor and Staffing Optimization

Your client works in financial services in the arbitrage business, which is quite lucrative. It has
no profitability problem and no competition. The company has 4 senior analysts, 3 junior
analysts, and I admin. The activities in which they are involved include the initial stage, which
comprises 20% of the work, the core stage which is 70% of the work, and the recommendation
which is the remaining 10% of the work. These percentages are constant. How many junior
analysts need to be added to free up capacity among the senior analysts, so they can focus on
selling additional work?
Background (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)
The interviewee should inquire about how much of the three activities the three staff persons
are engaged in. Senior Analysts do 60% initial, 20% core, and 80% recommendations. Junior
analysts do 30% initial, 70% core, and 20% recommendations. Admin does 10% initial and
10% core, with no recommendations.
Analysis (Calculations to be completed by interviewee.)
If you multiply the percentages that the junior analysts are doing by the breakout of the
activities, it looks like this:
30% of 20% = 6%
70% of 70% = 49%
20% of 10% = 2%
Therefore 6+49 + 2 = 57% is being done by the junior analysts.

"Flying to Mango
Increase Revenues

Our client is the CEO of a mid-size passenger airline based in Mexico D.F. The airline operates
on the Hub & Spoke model and is seeking to increase its revenue. It intends to do so by
switching the only airplane currently serving the flight to Mango, Brazil (an agricultural
outpost) to their existing New York line service. Is this a good idea?
Background (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)
The airplane serving the Brazil line is a Boeing B757 with 200 seats
■ Only one plane serves the Brazil line, making two round trips a day
The occupancy rate of the Brazil line is 90%
Each round trip ticket to Brazil costs $350
■ The New York line is currently served by 4 planes similar to the Brazil line plane
■The New York planes each make 3 round trips a day
■The occupancy rate of the New York line is 80%
■The ticket cost is the same. $350
■If an additional plane (and flight) is added to the NY line, occupancy rate will drop to
70%

■ Are costs relevant for this case? (They are not)
What is the revenue generated by each route?
■
Is there enough demand for NY flights to justify another airplane?
■ Does eliminating the Mango route have any repercussions on other flights to South
America?
Analysis (Calculations to be completed by interviewee.)
■Current revenue is $798,000
Brazil=200*2*0.9*$350 = 126k &
NY: 200*3*4*0.8*$350 = 672k
126k +672k = 798k
■New revenue would be: $735,000
NY only=200*5*3*0.7*$350","Calculations indicate that eliminating the Mango line would actually decrease overall revenues
of the airline. This is because the occupancy rates for the New York route drops when an extra
airplane is added to that line. In addition, removing the airplane that serves Mango completely
eliminates a highly profitable flight, and may cause service quality repercussions due to
unsatisfied customers."
"Deal or No Deal
Profitability
Opening (deliver rapid-fire with no pauses)
Jeff Zucker, the CEO of NBC has asked you for help. In 2006 NBC had profits of $3B on
revenue of $16.5B; these numbers have fallen 10% over the past three quarters. There has been
an $8M drop in ad-revenue due to the proliferation of specialized cable channels as well as
changing viewer preferences in media consumption. NBC's goals include achieving double-
digit growth, reducing costs by $750M, and spending $150M in digital initiatives in order to
grow $400M in revenue (from digital delivery) to $1B. Programming costs for television
shows have risen as shows average 60 scenes (vs. 40 scenes previously). Big-budget shows
such as Heroes cost $2.5M/episode and charge $200K/spot (there are 20 spots/hr). In addition,
on-demand media has cut into revenues although live entertainment is still a draw.
Background (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)
For question 3, keep stonewalling if the interviewee pursues any avenues related to ad revenue.
For example, if they say that advertisers will be less attracted to the demographic for shows
like Deal or No Deal, say ""that's already reflected in the price"". Concede answers involving
long-term strategy, competition, etc. but make it clear that those are not satisfactory answers.

"Online Publishing
Competitive Response, Increase Profits

A magazine publisher has seen their circulation drop and their ad revenue drop. They currently
have $700M in revenue spread across three types of magazines: fashion and beauty for teens,
fashion and beauty for women ages 24-40, and specialty magazines with 10-20K in
subscribers. Their online presence generates $21M in advertising revenue (of the total $700M)
and $9M in profit. They have brought us in to try to solve their circulation problem and
possibly boost their ad revenues. [For the interviewer: the real question at hand is, how can we
improve profitability for this client and adapt to the current marketplace?]
Background (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)
Viewers and advertisers are both moving online. The publishing company's two major
competitors have both invested a lot of money in online initiatives.
Current operations: they use a partner that charges them a portion of the hosting costs. They do
not have complete control over what ads are being shown with their contents.

1. Should they be more aggressive online and what capabilities do they need?
2. Brainstorm a bit about what else you could do other than simply moving your content
to a web server.","The interviewee should not immediately jump to the conclusion that the online portion of the
business is the cause of the problem (although this turns out to be the case, they should note
that the proportion of revenue from online activities is relatively small). Otherwise, the answer
is fairly open-ended, but should show an understanding of technology.
Topics the interviewee should address include:
(1) IT Organization - It is not enough to mention that they will need ""IT people""-a better
answer might be ""a designer that is well-versed in web-design software but will also be able to
create an online presence with a consistent look with the print magazine"".
(2) Project Phasing - Recognize the difficulty of launching new IT projects by suggesting that
since there are so many magazines in the publishing company's portfolio, moving these
magazines online could be done in a phased manner, perhaps by doing trial runs with the
specialty magazines before moving on to their more valuable brands.
(3) Vendor Relationships - Evaluate other hosting options or solutions. If the client is
dependent on a 3rd party service provider, can they bring the hosting in-house? Or issue an RFP
for a new provider with more favorable contract terms?
(4) Sources of Revenue - Is the client currently charging consumers for access to their online
portal? How do they track usage and unique visitors? The interviewee should explore whether
the client leverage new advertisers to reach the customers who are ""really"" using their online
channel.
(5) For the brainstorming component, the interviewee should mention the ability to cross-sell
magazines across demographics and the opportunities for mass customization.

"Mini Case
Competitive Response
Your client is a major metropolitan newspaper. The newspaper runs advertisements for employers
seeking employees (job ads/help wanted ads). Recently, the newspaper has realized that to compete it
must offer the ad space on its online addition as well. Online, it doesn't have traditional competitors -
its competitors are sites like Monster.com and Craigslist.com. It is looking to you to tell it how to
manage the migration from print to online.

1. How should they match the pace of the market as more employers go online?
2. Should they push employers to spend for online ads?
3. How can it maintain the revenue generated by printed advertising while still pushing for more
online revenue?

"Coca Cola Vending Machine
New Product Delivery Device

You are meeting with the head of new product development for Coca Cola to discuss a new
delivery platform Coca Cola has developed. Coca Cola does not generally make its delivery
platforms - it is usually delivered through fountains or vending machines. But Coca Cola has
recently been looking into developing a new vending machine. It's at the first level of
screening. It was born out of an idea the engineers at Coca Cola came up with and this
executive needs to know whether to use the vending machine or kill the idea.
This vending machine can change prices as the temperature changes. If it's hotter outside, the
price to the consumer will be higher. If it's cooler, the price goes down accordingly. Assume
there is no extra cost to making these vending machines and that they are easily implemented.
How would you evaluate this idea and what is your recommendation?
Background (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)
Coca Cola sales are seasonal - about 60% is bought in summer.
■ A Coke sells for around $1.00. Costs to produce are: 20 cents manufacturing and 75
cents in marketing. So there is 5 cents profit on each can.
■ Coca Cola does not expect to make more money on sales through this vending machine.
It expects the high prices (in hotter weather) and low prices (in colder weather) to even
out to be similar to current revenues.
(Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)
Coca Cola sales are seasonal - about 60% is bought in summer.
■ A Coke sells for around $1.00. Costs to produce are: 20 cents manufacturing and 75
cents in marketing. So there is 5 cents profit on each can.
■ Coca Cola does not expect to make more money on sales through this vending machine.
It expects the high prices (in hotter weather) and low prices (in colder weather) to even
out to be similar to current revenues.
•
.
(If the interviewee is really struggling) What problem at Coke might the engineers
have been reacting to when they decided to develop this machine?
What were they trying to solve?
Was it an attempt to reduce frequency with which Coke becomes ""flat"" in the
summer?
Was there an existing delivery problem that prompted Coke to take a shot at
delivering Coke themselves?
Anything else?
(If the third bullet has been revealed) Coke isn't expecting to make more money, but
what might they be trying to achieve? Think about the profit tree.
(If the interviewee thinks this is a no-lose idea) What might Coke want to think about
before introducing this delivery system? How might people react to it?","This is really a problem about two things:
The benefit of this machine is that it allows Coke to better forecast demand (by stabilizing
demand throughout the year) and therefore better manage its supply chain and make
distribution easier. While that might cut costs slightly, only 20 cents of every 95 cents is from
manufacturing. The major cost is marketing. If it needs to cut costs it should look at
marketing. Why? Because the reaction the public could have to this machine is dangerous.
Coca Cola is thought of as an all-American product. Changing prices with weather is not
aligned with the way people see the product. They might feel cheated by the machine. The
interviewee should definitely have touched on: cost savings, supply chain/forecasting issues
and public perception.
*** One point that the interviewee may want to explore is the fact that the machine only
monitors the temperature and price for Coke - it doesn't necessarily generate more or less
demand when it's hotter or colder - that trick is still confined to consumer behavior. "
"School Bus Business
Increasing Profitability

Your client is a school bus fleet operator. This means public schools outsource this function to
them. This client operates at a national level, and is the market leader at 50% market share of
the outsourced school bus fleet operation. Exhibit 1 shows the positioning in further detail.
Problem Statement: As you can see from Exhibit 2, the client operates in an industry with
razor-thin margins, and is now experiencing stagnant revenues and profits. In fact, smaller
fragmented players have even worse margins. What would you recommend to the client to help
it realize 5% profitability growth within a 2-year period?
Background (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)
On the revenue side, the client does not have extraordinary pricing power, market share is
maximized and further expansion has not come easy. In the background, realize that
customer (the school system) is also a price-sensitive entity
On the cost side, economies of scale and scope are already met, financial structure is
optimal, and operational best practices have been implemented successfully
[Explain Exhibit 2 line items to the student]:
o Capital Investment refers to buses, etc.
Maintenance Services refers to fleet maintenance and repair
Information Technology refers to fleet and driver scheduling, payroll, etc.
[Tell student that small operators will often use inefficient, expensive, in-house
development]
。 Personnel training means training of drivers on security, safe driving, and other
regulations. Quality of drivers needs to meet a certain high threshold, or schools
will switch to another operator - making this quite important.
[Tell student that fragmented operators will often under invest, as their margins
are already tighter As a result, they will often lose business to other fragmented
operators.]
Wages, etc. are fairly similar across this unionized industry
-
Consider the client's core capabilities and competencies
Draw out client's entire value chain (procurement, training, servicing, operation,
relationships with institutions...)
Exhaust argument that dramatic improvement not possible in current business model,
either on revenue or cost side
Eventually, lead in the direction that selective competencies should be developed into
business models and higher-growth, better margin, revenue streams (such as driver
training, procurement, auto service, etc. - served to the fragmented portion of the market,
which would then benefit from its economies of scale and learning)
What are the relevant portions of the value chain to focus on: (case writer's notes are in

"Credit Cards at Commercial Bank
Market Sizing and Segmentation

Our client is Commercial Bank which is analyzing growth strategies for its
credit card business in a developing country. The Bank wants to focus on
individual clients to whom it offers internet banking and retail channels. The
Bank wants to measure the opportunities in individual credit cards as a
stand alone business.
The target country has a population of 100 million. The most representative
demographic segments are as follows:
Hi Income: >$3,000/month
Mid Income: >$1,000/month and <$3,000/month
Low Income: <$1,000/month
Our client has asked us for the following two analyses:
Estimate the Market Size of the individual credit card business for each of
the demographic segments
Identify the most attractive segments for the Bank
Before we commence that analysis tell me how you would go about
assessing the potential of this new business.

","Answer
One way to measure market potential is by annual revenues. The different
sources of revenue for credit cards are:
-
-
-
Interest Income: interest rate x average outstanding balance
Transaction Income: transaction fee x average consumption
Membership Fee Income: Annual membership fee x number of credit
cards
The interviewee should also suggest other factors he/she would take into
account including:
-
-
-
Costs associated with the different segments; such as Administrative
Costs, Risk Cost, Service Cost and Marketing Costs
Competitor analysis: who are the key players in the market and which
segments are most competitive?
Brand positioning: is current brand positioning compatible with the most
attractive segments?
Current coverage: is the bank ready to serve the most attractive
segments in terms of geographical coverage for retail and in terms of
customer service (e.g. sophisticated support for High income and
straightforward support for Low income)
Analysis 2
Let's now turn to the first analysis our client has requested. What is the
approximate market size in dollars for this business?
Answer
Below is one suggested answer, but obviously a number of approaches
might legitimately be used.
The first step is to go from population to number of credit cards. The
interviewee should realize that not everybody will have a credit card; people
under-age or without any income should be excluded. In a developing
country we can assume that 50% of the population might have access to a
credit card. Next we should breakdown the qualifying population into the
three demographic groups to then calculate the number of credit cards:
-
-
Hi Income: 10% of qualifying population, average of 2 credit cards per
person
Mid Income: 20% of qualifying population, average of 1 credit card per
person
Low Income: 70% of qualifying population, average of 0.5 credit cards
per person
The number of credit cards by segment and total would be:
Total population = 100 M

The next step is to calculate the Bank's potential revenues from different
sources.
Interest Income. At this point, the interviewee should be provided with the
monthly interest rates and average outstanding balances per credit card for
the three segments:
-
Hi Income: 4% interest rate, $0 average outstanding balance
Mid Income: 7% interest rate, $300 average outstanding balance
Low Income: 10% interest rate, $140 average outstanding balance
Transaction Income
For this calculation, provide the interviewee with the following information:
the transaction fee is 1%, and the average annual consumption per credit
card for the three segments is:
Hi Income: $3,000/year consumption
Mid Income: $2,000/year consumption
Low Income: $1,000/year consumption
Annual Membership Fee
Provide the interviewee with the following information when he/she gets to
this point: the annual fee is fixed and is different for the three segments:
Hi Income: $70 membership fee
Mid Income: $50 membership fee
-
Low Income: $30 membership fee
Based on this information, the total revenue for the credit card market is
summarized as follows:

Analysis 3
What is your assessment of the most attractive segments for the Bank?
Answer
The figures show that the biggest segments are the Mid and Low income
segments. But to make a final recommendation the interviewee should take
other aspects into account, some of them mentioned above.
The Low income segment is the largest in terms of income opportunity but
will require the following considerations:
-
-
-
-
Higher default probability (discounted in the interest rate but not in terms
of administrative costs)
Higher costs because it requires a higher number of cards and clients to
serve
Higher marketing expenses if the current Bank brand positioning is not
compatible with the segment (as hinted by the Bank description)
Higher cost to serve, since this segment is less likely to use low-cost
automated channels (e.g. Internet of phone banking) and will require new
branches to service the segment
On the other hand, the Mid income segment is slightly smaller in terms of
income opportunity but may be more attractive given the factors mentioned
for the Low income segment. The cost advantages are impossible to quantify
with the available information. However, they are strong enough to conclude
that the Mid income segment is the most attractive to the Bank. The
interviewee should be able to identify some of these items or additional ones
and reach to me same conclusion.

"Cutting Costs at To-Dye-For Fabrics
Cost Reduction

Our client is a fabric producer called To-Dye-For Fabrics. The company
purchases fabric in bulk from overseas and then dyes batches of fabric in
colors ordered by clients. It produces 1.4 million square meters of product
each month and its average variable cost is $0.60 per square meter.
Processed batches have the following distribution:
- 40% of the batches are greater than 5,000 square meters
-30% of the batches are between 3,000 and 5,000 square meters
-30% of the batches are less than 3,000 square meters
To-Dye-For uses two different processes to dye its fabrics:
Continuous Dyeing: where washing and dyeing are integrated in a
continuous process. This process is used for 70% of the company's
production and is cheaper for batches of over 5,000 square meters.
Batch Processing: in which the washing and dyeing machines are
independent. The machines in this line need to be set up prior to each batch
being processed. Batch processing is used with the remaining production and
is cheaper for batches under 5,000 square meters.
If a batch has to be processed using a more expensive process, the cost is
$0.05 per square meter.
Our client has asked us to recommend how it might reduce its total costs.
How would you approach this problem?
Provide the following information if requested:
Client orders
Clients usually make one or two orders during a month. Those orders are
aggregated and usually fulfilled within 15 days.
(If the interviewee wants to progress this issue, advise him/her that the 15
day fill time is not crucial to customers...they are okay with having orders
filled within a month)
Processes
The set-up time for the Batch process machine is one hour and the installed
capacity for that process is 700,000 square meters/month (assuming no set-
up downtime).
Answer
The variable cost curve for the two processes can be represented as follows:
Variable Cost
Batch Process
5,000
Continuous dyeing
Batch Size
In other words, it is more expensive for the company to process batches
under 5,000 square meters in size via the continuous dyeing.
The interviewee should calculate the monthly production of 1.4 million
square meters is currently being split into batches as follows:
- batches less than 3,000 m² = 30% of 1.4m = 420,000 m²
-batches between 3,000 m² and 5,000 m²= 30% of 1.4m = 420,000 m²
- batches greater than 5,000 m²-40% of 1.4m = 560,000 m²
He/she should also calculate that currently the company is processing 70% x
1.4million = 980,000 m² of fabric using the continuous dyeing process.
This means that the company is incurring an over-cost of $0.05 x (980,000 -
560,000) = $21,000 per month by having to use the continuous dyeing
process for batches smaller than 5,000m².
The interviewee should be able to infer that this means that the Batch
Processing machines are working at full capacity. Given the total capacity of
the Batch processing process is 700,000 m²/month and only 420,000
m²/month (1,400,000 - 980,000) are produced, that means that part of the
time the machine is not producing because of set-up time. In fact we can
calculate that 60% (700,000 420,000) of the time the machine is
producing and 40% of the time it's being set-up.
","Recommendation to reduce costs:
Having identified the nature of the problem, the interviewee should turn to
recommending a solution.
One option is to buy another Batch Process machine. Even optimizing
production, the 40% non-producing time won't be enough to accommodate
the additional 420,000 m²/month that should be produced via Batch
Processing. Only one machine is needed since the larger orders would need
less set-ups than the <3,000m² batches.
If the interviewee reaches this point, you might ask them following
question:
What would be the maximum price to pay for the new Batch process
machine, knowing that the discount rate for the company is 10%?
Answer:
Assuming perpetual life for the new machine, the maximum price is
$2,520,000 ($21,000 * 12/10 %).
A second option involves considering client needs and in particular their
willingness to accept longer order fulfillment time. If that is possible, order
aggregation is possible and thus, larger batches can be processed. This is
likely to avoid the need to purchase an extra machine. Larger batches will be
processed using the continuous dyeing technology that seems to be the
most cost efficient.
Further recommendations for creating larger batches include integrating
planning processes with clients; training the sales force to encourage order
optimization; and designing incentives for both clients and the sales force.
"
"Marketing and All That Jazz
Increase Revenues

Your client is the Jazz at Lincoln Center (JALC), a leading not-for-profit arts
organization located in New York City. Under the artistic direction of
legendary jazz musician Wynton Marsalis, JALC is committed to providing
top quality Jazz performance and education to the world.
JALC has been in existence for 25 years. Until 2003, JALC had been housed
in the Lincoln Center Complex along side the Metropolitan Opera, New York
City Ballet, and Julliard School for the Performing Arts. In 2004, JALC moved
to the Time Warner Center a high end commercial and corporate complex
located on Columbus Circle. The move provided JALC with new, state-of-the-
art facilities, greater capacity (from 3000 to 4000 seats), and performance
venues with expansive views of Central Park.
JALC receives three primary revenue streams: subscriptions, single ticket
sales, and donations. JALC, like all major performing arts organizations,
relies on patron subscriptions to smooth demand and provide up-front cash
flows. The general rule of thumb is that 50% of tickets should be sold to
subscribers and 50% to single ticket holders.
The move to Time Warner Center has been a mixed blessing for JALC. In
response to significantly higher fixed costs (rent, utilities, etc.), JALC had to
increase ticket prices an average of 75%. However the move has also
generated significant press attention and general buzz across New York City.
Although attendance has been up since the move, subscription rates have
declined in each of the first two years in the new venue.
You have been hired by JALC's Director of Marketing to assist in boosting
subscription rates. On your way to the initial client meeting, you take a
second to compose your thoughts and brainstorm on the problem at hand.

","Answer
This is meant to be a very open ended question so push the interviewee to
be exhaustive in his/her analysis. The tendency will be to focus in on pricing.
That’s fine, discuss pricing but then get beyond it to identify all outlying
issues. Many frameworks will work, here is one approach:
Internal
Pricing
– Obviously the increased prices are beyond customers’ willingness to
pay.
– How do margins compare with the old scheme?
– What would happen if we lowered prices? Less revenue, unpredictable
cash flows, no upfront cash, low attendance at non-marquee shows
– Can we maintain elevated prices but boost willingness to pay? More
perks for subscribers, look for higher-end customers
Product
– How has the product changed since the move?
– Does the new venue attract the same caliber of performer?
– Is the new venue as or more comfortable as the old venue?
– How does the location affect consumers’ willingness to pay?
– What else are we selling beyond a show? Drinks? Merchandise?
Parking?
Promotion
– Is the advertising plan consistent with new location?
– Are we leveraging PR as effectively as we can?
Customers
– Marketing research to understand why old subscribers are leaving
– Why do people seem to prefer single tickets to subscriptions
Company
– Do we have fixed costs as low as possible?
External
Competition
– What new competitors/substitutes exist because of the move?
– How did old competitors respond to the move?
Macroeconomic
– Do people still enjoy watching jazz? Going to performances?
– Is the general economic downturn affecting people discretionary
spending?
– How is tourism doing? Are we over the 9/11 backlash?
– Was their a shift in regulations because of the move? New
taxes/zoning reqs?

Analysis 2
At the client meeting, the Director of Marketing is convinced that JALC needs
to significantly reduce ticket prices. She is particularly worried about
subscriber retention. From 1993 to 2003, JALC had an average subscriber
attrition rate of 10%. Over that same period, JALC had maintained
subscription rates at 50% of house capacity. Since 2003 this situation has
changed. The Director of Marketing presents you subscription data from
2003-2005 (figure 1) as proof that JALC needs to reduce prices. She asks
you to take a look at the numbers and see if you agree. She further asks
you to project what 2006 rates will be if prevailing trends continue.
Answer
The first key is to recognize that this picture looked very different in the
past. Typically, 90% were resubscribers and 10% were new subscriptions. In
2004, this ratio shifted to about 50/50. In 2005 it moved to 70/30. How
does this insight change your view of the case?
Next, notice that the new subscribers in 2004 resubscribed in 2005 (with
10% attrition). This is a good trend.
Now, let’s project 2006. (Ed note: On the surface this seems like a gross
assumption to make based on the limited data available. Lucky for us,
consultants do this all the time. Press the interviewee to state his/her
assumptions and forge ahead.) Break the 2006 subscribers into four groups:
– 2003 and prior subscribers: They left in droves over the past two
years, but those that remain are likely dedicated jazz fans and should
stick around. Assume 10% attrition giving us 350 subscribers
– 2004 subscribers: 10% attrition from 2005 numbers gives ~550
subscribers
– 2005 subscribers: Again 10% attrition from 2005 numbers gives ~380
subscribers
– 2006 new subscribers: This is the most difficult to estimate. Looking at
the last two years, in 2004 we had 650 new subscribers, 2005 we had
425. Based on this trend a reasonable estimate is 200 subscribers.
Prior to 2003 we were regularly able to attract 150 new subscribers.
The case mentions buzz and free PR so maybe we will be closer to the
2005 number of 425 new subscriptions? All in all, 200 seems like a
reasonable estimate.
– Adding it all up, a conservative projection is 1,480

Analysis 3
Thanks to your convincing logic and comprehensive thought process, the
Director of Marketing is convinced that your team can turn around JALC. As
you shake hands and joke about the weather, a pained look comes over her
face. “Wait a second. If we can grow our subscriber base by 10% a year we
will soon have to move again,” she says. Calculate how long it will be until
JALC is at capacity with subscribers.
Answer
This is a rule of 72 problem: at 10% compounded annual growth a
population will double every seven years.
JALC currently has 1,400 subscribers; capacity is 4,000 seats. In seven
years there will be 2,800 subscribers and in 14 years there will be 5600
subscribers. Therefore the answer is around 10 years. You would get an
“exact” number as follows:
Conclusion
At the end of your first day on the study, you happen to run into Wynton
Marsalis in the elevator. He asks how the study is going so far.
Answer
The interviewee should give a concise and complete summary of the key
insights from the case. Press them to synthesize rather than summarize. A
discussion of the next steps should also be included.

are AT&T and the like, and our client competes against companies like
Lucent and Alcatel for sales. This is an IP-driven business, and the market
has experienced a significant downturn in the last year.
The CEO of Comstock Telecom has asked your team to evaluate the future of
Core Control. How would you approach this problem?



","Answer
The interviewee should quickly identify that this is a mature product and
choose a framework that identifies the potential issues. One approach may
look like this:
1) Company
a. What is Comstock's strategy? Where does Core Control fit?
b. How LEAN is Core Control? A mature industry often requires price
leadership
c. What are the financials of Core Control? Are we making money?
d. What is Core Control's outlook:
i. can we sell it off?
ii. can we milk it to fund R&D of new technology?
iii. can we bundle Core Control with a more profitable service?
iv. should we cut our losses?
2) Competition
a. Who are they?
b. Are they taking market share or leaving this declining market? how
easily will they cede market share to us?
c. Do they have advantages over us (cost leadership; brand strength;
customer relations)?
3) Customers
a. Who are they?
b. Why aren't they buying IP components (new technology, declining
industry)?
c. Can we grow the market?
Analysis 2
The CEO wants to use Core Control revenues to fund new R&D. Last year,
our client earned 15% EBIT on revenue of $8b from Core Control. This year,
our client's revenues are expected to decrease with the market rate
(quantified: Year 1 = $50b; Year 2 = $25b). You've been asked to come up
with a rough estimate of what the business might look like this year from a
financial standpoint, and offer some thoughts on what this could mean going
forward.
Answer
This is primarily a ""numbers case,"" with the underlying exercise of
estimating a cost structure. The essential task of this case is to estimate a
cost structure for this year, determine what the EBIT will be, and discuss
what this could mean for the business going forward. The interviewee's
thought process in allocating costs is a crucial component of evaluation, and
should involve some discussion of how and why he/she decides to allocate
costs into the respective line items.
Revenues
Very simply, the interviewee can assume that revenues will decrease by the
market ""downturn"" (i.e. 50%, from $8b to approximately $4b)
Costs
Interviewee should begin by identifying the following basic costs items
(he/she can identify others, but if so, interviewer should suggest that he/she
bucket them into the following 4 basic items):
COGS
R&D
S&M
G&A
A logical next step would be for the interviewee to determine the total costs
from last year
EBIT was 15%, so total costs were 85% of sales, or $6.8b
The interviewer should then ask how these total costs might have been
allocated to the 4 basic costs items
One useful method is to first estimate how much each cost item will be as a
% of sales (with total costs summing to 85% of sales). General breakdown
should roughly align with:
COGS=50% of sales
R&D 20% of sales
S&M = 10% of sales
G&A =5% of sales
Generic logic:
COGS will be largest cost item
Since product is ""IP-driven,"" R&D will be next biggest expense
S&M and G&A will be smallest cost items
As long as interviewee defends his/her reasoning, these percentages can be
more/less than specified above.
Next, using these %'s, the interviewee can derive actual cost amounts for
last year (total costs = $6.8b):
COGS = 50% x $8b = $4.0b
R&D = 20% x $8b = $1.6b
S&M = 10% x $8b = $0.8b
G&A = 5% x $8b = $0.4b
To extrapolate costs to this year, the interviewee should separate the above
costs as fixed or variable (interviewer should prompt the interviewee to do
so if not done on their own):
All or significant majority of COGS will be variable (i.e. some small
portion of COGS may not vary with sales)
All or significant majority of R&D will be fixed
All or significant majority of S&M and G&A will be fixed (i.e. some
small portion of S&M may vary with sales)
Next, interviewee should split the calculated costs into fixed vs. variable.
Exact cost breakdown will vary, but should fall within basic parameters
outlined above (i.e. majority fixed vs. variable, or vice versa). For example:
COGS = $3.8 (var) + $0.2 (fix)= $4.0b
-
R&D $1.6 (fix) = $1.6b
S&M = $0.6 (fix) + $0.2 (var) = $0.8b
G&A = $0.4 (fix) = $0.4b
Thus, the interviewee will have derived (or thereabouts):
$4.0b in variable costs
$2.8b in fixed costs
The interviewee can then derive EBIT for this year:
With the 50% decrease in revenue, variable costs will decrease by
50%, with fixed costs remaining the same
Thus, $2.0b in variable costs, $2.8b in fixed costs
$4.8 in total costs
EBIT = ($0.8)b
Conclusion
Now that you have evaluated the outlook for Core Control, how would you
advise the CEO to proceed from here?
Answer
⚫ Based on costs and revenue, interview should find that business will lose
money this year.
• Interviewee should provide commentary (outside of limited case facts)
about why it may or may not be a good idea to get out of this business,
such as:
.
""market downturn could be an indication of the product's
obsolescence""
⚫ ""since this is an IP-driven business, business is cyclical and this
year's investment in R&D could generate a rebound next year""
⚫ propose modifying the cost structure
Answers will vary, but the focus of this case in the EBIT calculation"
"Taking Just Jets to Market
New Product Entry

We have been approached by the CEO of a start-up company called Just
Jets. The company has developed a small jet and needs our assistance in
formulating a strategy to take its product to market.
To date the company has spent $500 million in developing a prototype of the
jet it calls the Fusion500. The Fusion500 seats six people and comes
appointed with leather seats and the safety features of a Boeing or Airbus
jetliner. However it has little legroom for passengers and no bathroom. It is
simple enough to be flown by only one pilot and travels at over 430 miles an
hour which is much faster than other light aircraft that carry a similar
number of passengers.
The Federal Aviation Administration says it's on track to complete the
certification of the jet within the next two months.
The CEO has asked us for advice on a strategy to take the Fusion500 to
market.
We are meeting with the CEO in twenty minutes. What issues would you
want to explore with him initially?
Provide the following information if requested:
Price
Just Jets plans to sell the Fusion500 for $1.5m.
Costs
Rent per annum
$5m
Financing costs per annum
$14m
Plant & equipment per annum
$25m
Salaries of full time permanent employees
$1m
Variable labor cost per jet
$100,000
Materials per jet
$1m
Fixed overhead per annum
Variable overhead per jet
$5m
$300,000
Competition
Boeing and Airbus do not produce a jet similar to the Fusion500 and there
are no indications that they intend doing so.
Gulfstream, Cessna, Bombardier and Dassault all make corporate jets,
although none of them presently manufacture a jet of the size and
performance of the Fusion500.
Just Jets understands that three companies may be developing a very light
jet, namely Cessna, Honda and a start up Canadian company.
","Answer
You are looking for the interviewee to construct a logical and coherent
framework to analyze this new product and its prospects.
Many answers will be appropriate. This is an opportunity to drill down into an
interviewee's answers and get them to explain their reasoning and why
issues are important.
One approach is to use the 4Ps of price, promotion, product and place to set
out issues to be discussed with the CEO.
Also very relevant is the customer segment the company is targeting (which
will lead onto the second question).
Finally, the interviewee may want to explore the relevant supply chain and
how the company intends extracting value from it.
Analysis 2
The CEO has indicated an interest in two potential markets in particular: the
corporate jet market and the Air Taxi market. The latter market is made up
of operators who intend using the Fusion 500 to ferry passengers between
cities currently underserved by the big airlines.
Just Jets does not have the resources to position itself in both markets. The
CEO is convinced it must choose one.
The corporate jet market is well-established with big players such as
Gulfstream, Cessna, Bombardier and Dassault dominating. This year the
market for small to mid-size jets is estimated at $4 billion. Just Jets believes
it could be a niche player and secure 3/4 of one percent of that market.
The Air Taxi market is very much in its infancy and harder to estimate.
Present estimates indicate sales will be in the range of $200m to $600m. If
we take the midpoint of this range, what market share would Just Jets need
to secure to generate the same sales as the corporate market?
Answer
Estimated sales in corporate market
Midpoint of Air Taxi market
-0.75% x $4 billion
$30 million
= $400 million
Market share required in Air Taxi market = 7.5%
Analysis 3
Aside from just potential revenues what issues should Just Jets take into
account when choosing between the Air Taxi and Corporate markets?
Answer
The interviewee can discuss numerous considerations here. You should
engage him/her in discussion and probe the answers you are given. Ask
why, dig deeper, and test understanding. The interviewee should be able to
rationally and confidently discuss issues such as:
⚫ potential competitor response, including the strength of the
competitors
⚫market growth
geography - location of key customers
supply chain issues
power of customers
risk-the Air Taxi market is considerably riskier than the corporate
jet market
⚫profitability - the air taxi market has few if any competitors and
Just Jets may be able to command a higher margin
Porter's five forces is a useful framework to employ in comparing the two
markets.
Analysis 4
The CEO has also indicated he wants to know how many Jets the company
needs to sell in its first year to breakeven ignoring sunk costs. It would be
helpful if you could provide a rough estimate.
Answer
Breakeven Volume
fixed cost/net profit margin per unit
fixed cost/(price - variable cost)
If the interviewee does not recall the formula then give it to him/her and still
require him/her to perform the calculation.
The interviewee will need to ask appropriate questions to obtain the
information he/she needs to perform the calculation. Price and cost
information are provided above.
Annual fixed costs = $50m
The price of a jet is $1.5m
Variable costs are $1.4m.
Breakeven volume of jets
=50/(1.5 1.4)
= 500 jets
-
Conclusion
The CEO has just entered the room. He looks at you and says ""So, what are
your thoughts on my new plane?"" How do you answer?
Answer
You are looking for the interviewee to be structured and concise here.
He/she should pull approx three key points you have discussed and
summarize them appropriately for the CEO. The interviewee should also
indicate the next steps they would take in the project (e.g. confirm
estimated financials, conduct marketing research to refine market; etc.)"
"Tokyo Express
Market Sizing
Low
Estimate the number of passengers that pass through the Tokyo Main Station each day.
(Tokyo Main Station is one of the primary transportation hubs in Japan.)
Generally, no background information is provided for market sizing. Applicants should make
reasonable assumptions.
Population of greater Tokyo is approximately 8 million.
Trains run from 5am to 1am daily.
Bottom-up:
The applicant should consider what types of passengers (i.e. revenue streams) go through the
station on a daily basis. There are subways, bullet trains, surface lines, buses, and taxis.
Top-down:
Estimate the population for whom Tokyo station is the nearest station (residences, offices,
schools) and would presumably use public transportation to get to a different station.
However, Tokyo station is also used by many for transit, even if it is not the starting point or
final destination.","There is no right or wrong answer. Analysis should be Mutually Exclusive and Collectively
Exhaustive (MECE).
The ""mutually exclusive"" part can be difficult because simply calculating the number of people
that use the subway, train, bus, etc. respectively, and then adding those numbers together leads
to an overstatement. Someone might take the subway to get to Tokyo station then transfer to
the train, but counting this one individual in both groups is wrong.
The ""collectively exhaustive"" part is also difficult to estimate. Reasonable assumptions would
need to be made about peak hour traffic vs. off-peak hour traffic and occupancy/capacity of all
modes of transportation which pass through the station.
If a top-down approach is taken, the interviewee also needs to consider those people who may
live in the area but walk/ride a bicycle/drive a car to school or work.
A strong answer will include solid assumptions, as MECE an approach as possible, and
confidence when working through the calculations."

"Bright Mercury
New market entry
Moderate
Your client is a large diversified manufacturing corporation with a number of products. They
are a large player in the automotive industry but also have products within the consumer
products industry. Acquisitions are commonplace in this industry and your client recently
acquired another company in the consumer products space. After the acquisition, the team
found that the company has some intellectual property that could lead to the production of low
mercury compact florescent light bulbs. While mercury helps achieve high performance, it
also has hazardous properties. So your client wants to know what they should do with the
intellectual property.
Products: The company doesn't have lighting products within their mix. They do manufacture
similar devices within their automotive sector such as bulbs in the cars so they have the
capability to manufacture this new product.
Customer: Client works with large retailers and wholesalers
Technology: We believe the technology will work and will have great performance. There are
10 other patents with this technology. Client is 5 years ahead of competition.
Pricing: Average current price is $5 per bulb but technology will increase price 40% (calculate
$7)
Evaluate the company and understand their product mix, customers and distribution. Then
look at the external environment to understand the competitive landscape size of the market,
the various products in the market and any barriers to entry. Once the company's capacity to
manufacture the light bulbs and the competitive landscape are determined then determine if the
intellectual property is more valuable for the company to sell or to keep and manufacture the
product.
The student should also state upfront that the client has four options:
1) develop and market the light bulb itself (i.e. acting on the intellectual property)
2) sell the intellectual property
3) enter a joint venture to develop and market the bulb
4) hold onto the intellectual property and preserve the option to act on it
Analysis
To determine the best of these options the student will evaluate each. For the sake of
simplicity, the first two should be evaluated in depth first.
Option 1:
This could be assessed on an NPV basis over a number of years to capture the replacement
cycle and market growth.
Information needed:
Revenue:
⚫ Total size of commercial (b to b) and retail (b to c) light bulb market
Compact Flo bulbs current share of this market and likely growth rate
⚫ Evaluation of client's market share capture with the low mercury bulb
⚫ Likelihood of competitor entry and potential impact on client's market share
This is all to get to the total revenue per year (price x volume) per year (which you
would expect to change from years 0 to 6
Example of Market sizing: Assuming product will be sold first to households then with success
move to businesses. 100M HH in the US
20M - 1 bedroom- 8 light bulbs - 160M light bulbs
40M-2 bedrooms - 10 light bulbs - 400M light bulbs
40M-3 bedrooms-12 light bulbs -480M light bulbs
Total 1040M light bulbs in market
This is a broad assumption since the business market would be far larger and be a market to
target first. Distribution is likely far more consolidated as well. Students would ideally go
beyond consumer facts and have some sense of business data.
Costs:
Incremental fixed costs to current business:
Student should go through the value chain of development to manufacturing
/packing/marketing/distribution to evaluate any fixed costs that would be added due to this
business.
Costs of goods sold (variable):
Include all costs from manufacturing/packing/marketing/distribution to determine the
Total cost per bulb x Volume projected during the revenue
The student should then calculate the total operating profit per year (possibly factor in
corporate tax to be accurate) and calculate the NPV.
Option 2:
The same data used above would be the value of selling the option. The student would need to
explore whether the value to another company would be greater due to any impacts on revenue
(e.g., higher volume due to one fewer competitors entering the market) or costs (potentially a
buyer has better capabilities for the product and therefore the incremental fixed costs or
variable costs of goods sold are lower.
Option 3:
This could be tested verbally rather than quantified for the sake of time. The student could ask
about the potential of reducing their own costs by outsourcing or partnering with another
entity.
Option 4:
This is likely not a good answer unless the market growth may spike so significantly in year 2
that it would offset a new entrant in year 5. This would just be a good point of discussion.
Interviewer: Based on the market sizing above, consider what is the average life span of
the new light bulb.
A total of five years
So there are approximately 208M light bulbs sold per year (total market 1040M/5 years) so
the maximum revenue per year is
208M $7-$1,456M
Assuming that they don't capture the entire market...
Life of light bulb (at what point will the market be saturated and due to the longer life of the
product. At that point they can enter into businesses and then maybe international.
Look also at pricing later because if the product life span is 5yrs versus current 6months-1 year
then there is possibly an opportunity for higher prices or to decrease the life span of the bulb so
not to jeopardize future sales.
Interviewer: Please summarize your findings.","Recommend the manufacture of the light bulb because it increases revenue by $17M for each percent of the market they capture. They are also ahead of the competition so will be first to market and can become the standard. They need to create marketing and education plans to accomplish commercialization of the product since it is priced higher than current bulbs. Things to consider: If there is excess capacity to manufacture, there will be additional costs. • Create a prototype to see if bulb meets expectations. ⚫ Financial capabilities to develop since the company has a strong R&D group."
"Call It Excess Capacity
Pricing Strategy, Competitive Response, Supply Chain
Moderate
We are consulting for VoiceDirect. They have been packaging and reselling excess capacity
on their cellular network to highly fragmented prepaid phone card buyers. Over the past year.
VoiceDirect has lost significant market share. What is happening, and how can VoiceDirect
recover?
Background and Areas of Discussion
Who are the competitors? Only three other players (Sprint, AT&T, T-Mobile)
What is the pricing? VoiceDirect charges five cents per minute, all three other competitors
charge three cents.
Ask candidate to calculate VoiceDirect's percentage price premium
The price premium is equal to 66%
The candidate should first draw a diagram to understand the market. The cellular market in the
US is divided into Contract (or pay after usage) and Prepaid minutes. We are not analyzing the
""contract"" segment. The competitors' strategy is to sell their excess capacity to the prepaid
market. In light of current economy conditions and with the assumption that people who rely
on prepaid cards are mostly those who have difficulty getting Contracts due to a bad credit
history, this segment is growing.
The candidate then should ask what is the excess capacity for VoiceDirect (we can assume near
infinite capacity) as well as demonstrate understanding that the marginal cost for providing this
capacity is zero.
At this stage the candidate should try to evaluate the issues behind the loss of market share.
After computing the VoiceDirect's price premium (66%) the candidate should establish three
hypotheses. (1) There is no differentiation that justifies the price premium, technological
(quality of the signal), geographical (geographic availability), customer service, etc... (2)
There is differentiation but it is not perceived by the market; (3) there is differentiation, the
market perceives it but because of its place on the low end of the segment, people are not
willing to pay for it.
For scenarios (1) and (3), a possible strategy would be to match the competitors' prices, go
from five cents/minute to three cents/minute. At this point, the candidate should argue that if
VoiceDirect's prices for postpaid cards are larger than 3 cents/minute, there is the possibility of
cannibalization of their customer base.

top-down process)
⚫ Can we enter into a contract at a set price to provide minutes to major prepay
providers? The answer is no, Virgin Mobile already has an agreement with one of our
competitors. The rest of the market is very fragmented.
Can we vertically integrate and repackage the minutes ourselves, creating our own
prepay brand? Or is Virgin's presence too strong to compete?
⚫ Does the price premium reflect down to the consumer level, or do the repackagers (gas
stations, Wal-Marts, etc) eat the price delta? Would it make sense to renegotiate with
repackagers to lower their margins?
Analysis
Price premium percentage (as seen above). The marginal cost of providing extra minutes (it's
zero)
Key Takeaways
Even though five cents versus three cents seem small, the resulting 66% price premium
becomes a major issue as purchase volumes go up. It costs VoiceDirect nothing to provide
more minutes, as capacity is unlimited. Providing that there will be no cannibalization of their
postpaid customer base, there is only upside in matching the competitors' prices.","Immediately cut the price to at least the competitor level for repackaging purposes. Assess whether it will be effective for VoiceDirect to go into prepay repackaging market. (This is important since people with bad credit and people under age 18, for example, cannot enter into contracts with VoiceDirect.) At this point, if there is still time, ask the candidate to estimate the impact of his or her recommendation, in percentage changes in demand. (tell candidate that elasticity for these type of products is approximately -1.25. Candidate should explain what Elasticity is and why it is negative. (e (ADemand/Demand)/ (APrice/Price))"
"Healthcare Fun
New market entry/Market size
Moderate
Your client is a healthcare insurance company that serves the Medicare population. Over the
past two years, your client and some other healthcare insurance companies have started
offering ""private fee-for-service"" (PFFS) to their respective Medicare patients. The benefit to
the patient is that with PFFS, the patient has access to ""out-of-network"" providers that
otherwise would not be covered by their health insurance plan. With the PFFS program, the
patient interacts with their healthcare insurance company directly, while Medicare compensates
the insurance company for the fees involved.
As I mentioned, your client launched their PFFS program two years ago. They expect the
product to gain in popularity among their members. Other healthcare insurance companies
also expect PFFS to grow. However, many insurance companies who have started offering
PFFS are concerned because they do not currently have the additional administrative support
needed in their billing departments to process all the PFFS claims.
Your client is therefore interested in launching a ""b to b"" model to offer billing services to
other healthcare insurance companies that are looking to outsource the work involved in
processing PFFS claims.
Is it a good idea for your client to offer this new service?
Your client is a small, regional plan.
Client is already offering the service for their own members, so startup costs are minimal.
Assume the administrative staff/infrastructure needed is already in place.
Potential areas of interest:
Company
• Customer
Size of market
What types of healthcare insurance companies are offering PFFS/Who are the customers
for this service?
Although both small and large healthcare insurance companies are offering PFFS, only small
plans would need to outsource the back office services needed to process PFFS claims (since
large plans already have the necessary administrative support in place to process claims).
How big is the market for this new service?/What is the growth rate?/What percentage of
Medicare members are enrolled under PFFS?
See analysis below
Do not focus on financials/profit; if asked, let the interviewer know that the client is looking to
get at least 100 customers (small healthcare insurance companies) by the year 2015. The client
is confident that, by 2015, they can capture at least 80% of the market for this service.

After Candidate calculates the numbers above, provide the following information:
In 2015, the average number of Medicare members in the small health plans that are interested
in the service your client is offering is 40,000 members. How many potential customers will
there be in 2015?
Answer: Given that five million members in total will be using PFFS in 2015 (calculated
above), 5 million/40,000-125 health plans using PFFS that are interested in outsourcing their
back office work.
At this point, let the Candidate know (if you haven't already) that the client is confident
they can capture 80% market share by 2015.
So, 80% of 125 clients is 100.","Only small plans that offer PFFS will look to outsource the back office services, not large plans In 2015, there will be approximately 125 small plans interested in outsourcing their back office services for PFFS billing ⚫ With 80% of the market share, the client would be able to meet its goal of 100 customers by 2015, so yes, they should offer the service Risk to be considered include Considering that we are a small insurance plan, would it be possible for us to scale our billing department to service 80 customers As customer service is important especially for Medicare members (age > 65 years), would we maintain quality of service required with the rapid growth to 80 customers in five years"
"Prosumer's Purchase
New Market Entry
Moderate
You are the Vice President of market development for an US mid sized consumer packaged
goods (CPG) company called Personal Care Company (PCC). Your company sells three
product lines generating $50M in annual revenues:
1) skin care (with skin protective and sun-blocking properties)
2) tampons (very absorbent features)
3) baby care bottles (impact resistant)
Your company has just been acquired by Prosumer, a global CPG company that makes
batteries and shaving products. How would you recommend increasing PCC's sales from
$50M to $100M in 2 years post acquisition?
There are potential synergies in distribution between Prosumer and PCC related to shaving and
skin care products. PCC should look to grow geographically to new markets. One criterion is
to focus on areas that are greatly exposed to the sun.
Another focus is to look at the ability of PCC to finance the expansion so it may want to divest
another product line if it is not performing as well as sun care such as either the tampon or
baby care lines.

Interviewer: Based on this information, which two markets would you want to focus on
first and second? Why? The candidate then is asked what are the ways he/she will
expand in each market.
Phase 1: Enter the Asian market can be first for its high growth and market potential. The
company can take advantage of its core functionality for sun protection and sun blocking since
the Asian market values maintaining fair skin to avoid suntans. Market entry includes
establishing suppliers, retail distribution, addressing the competitive reaction, marketing, any
language or cultural issues and local government regulations.
Phase 2: Enter the Latin American market based on the products' skin care functionality.
Phase 3: Sell product to the distributors and acquire a supply chain.
Interviewer: If the retail price per case is $150, and the mark up margin by the
distributor to the retailer is 50%, and the markup from your company (manufacturer) is
100%, what is the cost of each case?
Take $150/1.5 - $100 price to distributor.
Take $100/2 $50 cost from manufacturer
Interviewer: What are some savings and costs associated with the use of a distributor?
Significant cost savings can be accomplished by
Recognizing synergies from having PCC use the same supplier and distribution
networks already in place by Prosumer
Cost savings from further economies of scale
However, the main costs of discontinuing with PCC's current supplier are:
⚫ Contract costs of terminating the relationship short of the agreed upon expiration
⚫ Sunk costs of the inventory that the current supplier will no longer be motivated to
support as the relationship has ended
Fees to the new supplier",PCC should look to leverage the synergies from Prosumer such as similar product lines in skin care and access to the global market using Prosumer's international suppliers and networks. The expansion into the global markets should be evaluated along the preferences of each geographical region based on market growth potential first in Asia and then Latin America. Each region would require different marketing strategies that match each area's preferences from functional to lifestyle aspirations benefit propositions. The expansion has opportunities for significant cost savings from synergies in sharing. suppliers and distributors that would need to be above the costs of terminating PCC's existing relationships.
"Slippery Sales
Increase profitability
Moderate
Your client is a consumer electronics retail chain selling products such as TVs, DVD players,
digital cameras, and cell phones. Sales have varied dramatically across your client's stores
with several experiencing a severe decline in revenues over the past two years.
How can you help the client even out performance across the individual stores and increase
performance of the entire chain through organizational change?


The interviewer should know that the problem is in the client's sales decline but occurring only
in a limited number of stores. The interviewer starts by asking the candidate to design an issue
or a hypothesis tree (whichever one the candidate feels more comfortable with).
The first level of the tree should separate externalities (aggressive competition, decrease in
market demand, etc..) from internal issues. The candidate should then be told to focus on
internal issues. Some of the problems the candidate should come up with are: weak marketing
strategy, poor choice of product mix shown in stores, low knowledge base of employees (sales
force), ineffective incentives program for the sales force, poor after-sale customer service,
etc...
To guide the candidate the problem solution, the below numerical data shall be provided and
carefully analyzed. These numbers belong to one of the stores facing a decrease in sales.
Based on this information the candidate should be asked how he or she would calculate the
sales CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) over the past 2 years. If the candidate does not
know the formula, the interviewer can provide it as necessary. The answer is as follows:
CAGR (2007 Sales / 2005 Sales)^(1/2)-1)
The interviewer can then provide the following data to the candidate for analysis:
Product
Accessories
Plasma TV
$7.00M
DVD player
$5.00M
Sales Gross Profit Margin
$2.50M $1.25M 50%

$5.00M $5.30M $5.50M 5%
$7.00M $6.30M $5.70M -10%
$2.50M $2.00M $1.60M -20%
The candidate should reach the following conclusion when analyzing the data.
The product lines with the negative CAGRS are those with the highest margin and they are also
some of the most technologically complex products. These products would require a higher
level of customer service to help customers become better informed in order to make proper
buying decisions.
Customer service is lacking at many stores because of a lack of consistent training. Currently,
training of sales employees is decentralized through an apprenticeship model, and at stores
which perform poorly, the lack of adequate training is perpetuating poor store performance.
The largest revenue streams come from complex electronics such as Plasma TVs and digital
cameras where product knowledge must be high among sales associates.","Having identified the problem, the candidate should mention a set of possible solutions and make a recommendation based on a high level assessment of those possibilities. One solution is to centralize the training program. Store managers can attend training seminars at the corporate headquarters and then disseminate their knowledge back to their staff. Such an arrangement would reduce the cost of training and streamline the knowledge transfer process Corporate headquarters can also distribute training materials to ensure that associates are trained consistently across all stores. Product manufacturers can also create brochures or in- store collateral to help promote information about their products. The store may want to share such costs through trade spend negotiations with the manufacturers. Additionally, the incentive structure may need to be adjusted to ensure associates follow the training program closely. The client may think about using quantitative metrics, such as Sales per Average Hour (SPAH) to measure the productivity of sales associates."
"Patty Joint Shelton
Response to Competitor
High
Your client is the owner of a Patty Joint (PJ) franchise in the small town of Shelton,
Connecticut (population 40K). The restaurant's revenues are trending downward but costs are
stable. What are your thoughts on:
1) Cause of the issue
2) How to achieve growth of the business
There are no changes in customer tastes. The menu, food quality and suppliers are the same.
The main cause in the sales drop is the opening of a new competitor FinerFoods Restaurant
that opened across the street. It is a fast food ""plus"" style restaurant that serves not only
burgers, but also a broader menu (chicken, pasta, burritos) with table clothes and waiter
service. FinerFoods Restaurant has a family-friendly atmosphere.
Do not give the below information unless candidate asks about the restaurant's customers.
There are two main customer segments served by Patty Joint:
1) Business customers for lunch (60% of your clientele)
2) Families for dinner (40% of your clientele)
Patty Joint is losing both its business lunch and family dinner segment to the new competition.
Analysis
Interviewer: Which customer segment is more important and more profitable between the
business and family segments?
By reviewing the profitability of Patty Joint by customer:
⚫ Lunch garners an average profit of $8/customer
⚫ The overall average profit is $10/ customer
Interviewer: What is the average profit for the dinner segment?
The candidate should ask for the following information to back solve for a weighted average:
Lunch is 60% of the customer segment
Dinner is 40% of the customer segment
Once the candidate asks for the number of customers, s/he can use a weighted average formula
to find the profitability per customer for the dinner segment.
⚫ (0.60)*($8) + (0.40)*(SX) $10/overall average profit per customer
⚫ X-profitability for the dinner segment is $13/customer, which is more profitable than
the lunch segment for Patty Joint. It would likely recoup the loss of this customer
segment from FinerFoods.
Interviewer: If the total average profit margin is 50%, what is the overall average revenue per
customer?
$10/0.50 $20/revenue per customer (customers really like burgers)
Interviewer: FinerFoods Restaurant's revenues are 20% higher and costs are 10% higher than
that of PJ's overall average customer. What is the average profit per customer at FinerFoods
Restaurant?
Sales: (1.20)*$20-$24
Costs: (1.10)*$10-$11 Note: The costs for Patty Joint is determined by revenue less
gross margin from above ($20-$10-$10)
⚫ Profit - $13
Insight: FinerFoods has a more profitable business at $13 vs. PJ's $10 per average
customer.
Interviewer: How would Patty Joint determine why their customers are leaving?
Suggested answers:
1) Create customer satisfaction survey - be sure to account for biases by interviewing an
equal number of regular vs. one-time customers
2) Ask corporate headquarters to provide information on performance of other PJ
restaurants due to effects of a nearby FinerFoods (or similar competitor) opening to
determine if customer defections are widespread
3) Industry publications
Interviewer: You now have a chance to create some customer survey questions. You can
ask any customer but state whom the survey is tailored toward and state your most
important question. (Provide opportunity for the candidate to state various survey
audiences and question possibilities).
Wait until after candidate finishes the exercise then state the following:
Interviewer: We have some additional survey data collected and here are the results:
First survey audience consists of PJ defecting family dinner customer:
Question: What are important factors in your purchase decisions?
Survey Answer. Family dinner customers value price and service. They are price sensitive and
like the perception of FinerFoods as providing value. FinerFoods also has waiter service so the
parents do not need to clean up after their children's meals, viewed as quick. The prices are
comparable to PJ although 20% higher.
Second survey audience consists of PJ defecting business lunch customer:
Question: What are important factors in your purchase decisions?
Survey Answer: Business lunch customers value speed and convenience. They perceive PJ as
providing relatively slower service and less convenience than FinerFoods since FinerFoods has
waiter service. While the time spent at with waiter service at FinerFoods and the time spent
waiting in line at PJ is about the same, the perception is that FinerFoods is faster service.
Interviewer: Which customer segment would you focus on based on your survey information
and recommend solutions to help your PJ restaurant client. You cannot hire any additional
service staff nor change their menu offerings (per corporate policy).
Focus on the more profitable family dinner customer (at the higher $13/profit per customer vs.
$8/lunch) and one possible solution includes:
Providing entertainment for children at PJ such as a playground, a clown, or offer promotions
on birthday or other special celebrations to make PJ a destination of choice for family events.
PJ can also reduce the amount of packaging so there is less to clean up for the family. The
children may drive the decision of parents to frequent PJ if they view the restaurant as more
attractive and fun.","Interviewer: Please summarize your findings (cause of the sales deterioration, and recommended solutions to address the problem faced by your Patty Joint franchise)."
"Apparel Outsourcing
Operations, Outsourcing, Cost reduction
High
Our client sells women's apparel in the US market. They are known as a low-cost competitor
and sell their apparel through multiple outlets and retail stores. They are looking at several
options to cut costs even further and they'd like our opinion on how they can do that.
They currently manufacture products in two plants, one in the US (Ohio) and one in
Guatemala. A third party vendor in China supplies the remainder of their demand.
They are thinking of closing the US plant and want us to determine if this is a good idea, If so,
where should they move their operations to worldwide?

and Areas of Discussion
Several frameworks will work for this. However, in the end this is a cost cutting case so at
some point the interviewee should look at some sort of Cost/Benefit analysis by location and
keep in mind what are the client's core competencies and strengths are.
For example:
The Company:
⚫ Current state of sales: Growing or Shrinking:
(The interviewee should ask this to get a feel for future productions needs.)
⚫ What are their major cost drivers?
(Labor, Materials, Shipping, etc....Let the interviewee come up with these on their
own.)
⚫ What is their product truly know for?
(As said in the intro...Low-Cost competitor.)
⚫ Are they currently delivering that strength to their customers? (Yes)
. What are the risks in closing the US plant, aside from costs?
(Lead the interviewee to come up with things like bad press, labor negotiations, closing
costs, increased shipping costs, etc)
Revenues and costs
What are the revenues and costs of their current US production facility in order to get a
baseline on what closing the US plant will save them.

(If the interviewee is stuck on getting more outsourcing from China since the client is
already outsourcing there, draw their attention back to the costs in China compared to
both the US and Guatemala.)
Other plants in Guatemala?...Go to Part 2
Part One: Current State Analysis:
All three producers produce completely equivalent product. There are no quality issues or
differences between US, Guatemala, and China production
The US plant is over 15 years old. Its equipment is old and fully depreciated. Maintenance
costs have been increasing significantly the last few years as the equipment continues to age.
The Guatemala plant is relatively new and in good shape.
The Interviewee should ask for the following pieces of data. This data should only be given
when asked for. The interviewee should be able to construct an organized table like the one
shown below.

Part Two: Alternate production Possibilities:
There are 10 other apparel manufacturers with plants in Guatemala.
Half of the 10 plants have approximately 1/3 excess capacity each.
Using this excess capacity would result in nearly the same costs as the client currently
gets from their own Guatemalan plant.
⚫ The 5 plants with capacity break down as follows:
o P1) 10K units excess capacity,
° P2) 20K
°
P3) 15K
° P4) 25K
。 P5) 10K
Analysis
First, the interviewee should construct a table resembling the one shown in the ""Background""
section.
Part One: Current state analysis:
The Interviewee should calculate
A) Total costs per product per supplier:
The Chinese vendor is the most costly at $7.00/unit
The US currently costs $6.50/unit
⚫ Guatemala is the lease expensive at $5.50/unit
B) If the US plant is closed, its 125K units of production cannot be accommodated by
Guatemala and China. The other two vendors can currently accommodate only 15K units from
the US.
Part Two: Alternate production Possibilities:
The next step is to ask the Interviewee where they would find the excess capacity to account
for the lost US production of 125K units. Answers could include expanding the Guatemala
plant, leveraging the contact in China to find new outsourcing resources, looking at other
apparel plants in Guatemala for their excess capacity, or seeing outsourcers in other emerging
markets (Vietnam, India, Philippines, South America, Etc) If the interviewee is stuck on
getting more outsourcing from China since the client is already outsourcing there, draw their
attention back to the costs in China compared to both the US and Guatemala.
C) The interviewee should calculate how much capacity the five other plants in Guatemala can
provide:
10K units excess capacity + 20K + 15K+ 25K+ 10K 80K units' total of capacity
D) Determine if this capacity is enough to handle completely closing the US plant:
(125K units from US)-(15K units placed in current production locations) - (80K units placed
in other Guatemalan plants) 30K units remaining to be placed.","Recommended Conclusion. Suggested recommendations to the CEO: Close the US plant and move as much production as you can to Guatemala. However, what are the risks upsides with closing the plant? (1) Retire old equipment and save excess maintenance costs (case is clear about this one). (2) Profit from sale of the plant building? Are there any dollars from selling the building that can be redirected to Guatemala? It does not have to be specific, but should come up in discussion. An example summary: ""After examining the costs of producing at your US plant, your Guatemala plant and your current China outsourcing arrangement we feel it would be beneficial to close your US Plant. Even though this may produce some bad press in the US, your costs are much less elsewhere. Specifically, your Guatemala plant has low costs and we recommend moving all of your operations there. We realize that your current plant arrangement cannot handle all of the US production, so we recommend retrofitting your Guatemala plant to handle approx half the US capacity, and source the remaining half from other manufacturing sites in Guatemala. During the year that the plant is being retrofitted capacity can either be bought from other vendors in Guatemala, at a premium, or do phased closing of the US plant to handle the leftover production. A study on the costs of retrofitting the plant vs. purchasing additional production from vendors would need to be undertake and we would be happy to help you with that."""

of timing the launch of a new drug that just received FDA approval?

Background and Areas of Discussion
This is a qualitative case with a nice twist at the end. The interviewee has to think outside the
box to get to the solution. There is room for the interviewee to draw the pharmaceutical value
chain during this case (added bonus).
The candidate should think about the following areas within his or her framework:
⚫ The Launch and Market Share Objectives of the Company
The Competitive Landscape
The Financial Implications
","Timeline - the launch should indeed be delayed as the client is still in the first quarter and this gives them time to sharpen their strategy with us and leverage the following- Identify weaknesses from the competition's launch Allow the competition to preempt key customers and then target the unmet market Wait until the competition has set their brand strategy and use the time to target a differentiated brand strategy ■ Positioning and alignment with key customers especially while negotiating contracts with distributors and clinics (the competitor contracts would be public knowledge at this stage) There is benefit to being second-to-market, as long as a strategic plan is incorporated, inclusive of various scenarios.

promotion for a major sporting event in 2008 e.g. the Super Bowl.
What factors should Fizz Soda consider in order to make this decision, and what
recommendation should be given to Fizz Soda?
Background and Areas of Discussion
Background and Areas of Discussion
1. Previous campaigns and scope of proposed campaign
a. Discuss any previous campaigns and any learning points
i. Previous campaigns have generally been successful, but Fizz Soda has
found that they make most profit from high profile campaigns
ii. Previous campaigns have involved prizes ranging from soccer balls or
basketballs (depending on the campaign) to all expenses paid trip to a
sporting event
b. Lead time involved in changing the design of labels on bottles and bottle tops is
minimal and is zero cost
c. Proposed campaign:
iii. Discuss the type of sporting event. 2008 is a big year with the Olympics
and annual sporting events such as the Super Bowl, NBA playoffs etc
iv. Collect bottle tops and claim varying level of prizes vs. lucky bottle tops
for grand prize vs. another idea or combination of all
v. Begin promotion three months before the event
Analysis
The analysis should not focus on the total beverage market, but instead focus on the
incremental Fizz Soda sales that would be gained by the promotion over both the short-term
and long-term (by customers switching from Coke to Fizz Soda).

"TV/Film Retake
Competitive response, increase profits, turnaround
High
The client is a leading TV/film studio that has several lines of business. They are particularly
concerned about one part of their business which provides postproduction services internally as
well as for external customers.
This division has experienced stagnating profits in the recent times. They have hired you to
explore ways to address this problem, and increase the profitability of this business.
The postproduction services division is comprised of four distinct products:
Restoration of old films for preservation
Production of master prints for theaters and exhibition
Production of master copies for the home entertainment market
Production of daily material for review during ongoing film production
It is common in the movie industry to outsource these functions. However, based on the studio
market research they know that their internal rates for these services are comparable to the
market rates. The CFO of the client wants to know what strategic options he has to increase
profitability.
(Note: The interviewee should note that since there are no monetary benefits from
outsourcing, it should not be a concern.)
The interviewer finishes presenting the case by asking the following questions:
The interviewer should only provide the information in Exhibit I in response to the interviewee's questions, and should also lead the interviewee to think about these main issues. Exhibit 1: Main issues to consider (Not to share with interviewee, use for feedback) SERVICE CUSTOMERS ISSUES Customers care TREND (Market) Restoration Master Theater New Productions Home entertainment about the quality of Stable the services Customers care about the quality Master Home and also the price of the services Decreasing in recent times Dailies On going Movie Productions They care about the Stable speed of the service SG&A costs have been stable and are shared among the service lines. A recent benchmark study has shown that these costs are consistent with industry norms. If interviewee asks for further financial information provide Exhibits A and B from the Handouts/Figures section below. Analysis/Problem solving The interview should first try to answer the first question since it will help him structuring the following ones. Possible recommendations for each business unit are: Expand, boost revenues (marketing), lower costs (operations), close, sell, spin-off, etc. For the next question the interviewee should consider criteria as: gross margin, market trend, nature of business (core/non core), percentage of revenues vs. total revenues of the business unit, ease of implementation of possible solutions, risk as in possible competition responses, etc... The interviewee must calculate gross margins (Revenue - Cost)/Revenue by service using data provided on exhibit A. Alternatively the candidate can calculate revenues and costs per job based on the numbers given in Exhibits A & B, and then gross margin and profits to compare the profitability of the four services. Any attempt to compare based only on total revenues, or COGS, etc would be inaccurate and should be pointed out as such during feedback.
The use of Exhibit B in the analysis process should be pointed to the candidate at the end as
unnecessary/ over complication (constructive feedback making him realize that in some
occasions the interviewer intentionally provides misleading information).
Exhibit 2 below is provided as an aid for the interviewer to guide/follow up the interviewee's

Note: A strong candidate will consider the whole market when analyzing the
recommendations. The risk inherent to every decision comes mainly from the market response.
Example, deciding to close/sell/spin-off a service might lead to total loss since for instance the
competitors may start to offer bundles of products which would lead the customers to choose
them to take advantage of the discount rather then split their requests.
Key Takeaways
The decision model should be consistent along the different services considering (1) gross
profit margin; (2) contribution to total revenues; (3) nature of service, core/ non-core; (4) ease
of implementation/ risk
","The candidate should address all four of the questions provided at the beginning of the case and develop a framework that addresses the decision criteria for deciding what to do with each service line. Financial as well as strategic factors should be considered. There is no one specific answer, but the recommendations should be grounded in reasonable conclusions derived from the financial data provided and sound calculations made by the interviewee. A strong candidate will address the SG&A allocation issue among the service lines to further complement the analysis carried out. The recommendation should also include a risk analysis and implementation/next steps for the division."
"Wine in Boxes
Increase Profits
Moderate
Our client is the CEO of an Australia-based winemaker that is the market leader in its country.
The company has two types of products: bottled wine and boxed wine. Recently, profits have
been decreasing, and the CEO believes that this is due to losses in the boxed wine division. We
need to assess the situation and provide a recommendation.
1) What factors should we consider to determine whether the boxed wine is a good business?
2) What is the profitability of each of the two divisions?
3) What is our recommendation?
Background (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)
The company is currently losing money
Sales are split evenly between the two divisions
■ Bottled wine sells for Australian US$ 5 p/unit; Boxed wine sells for AUS$10 p/unit
Bottled wine contains 750ml; Boxed wine contains 3 liters
■
A plastic bag holds the wine inside the box
Both products have an overhead of AUS$0.50 p/unit
■Raw material, consisting of grapes, costs AUS$2 for the bottled wine
■ Packaging costs AUS$1 for both products, while other variables (distribution and labor)
are AUS$1 per bottle and AUS$2 per box.

■Raw material, consisting of grapes, costs AUS$2 for the bottled wine
■ Packaging costs AUS$1 for both products, while other variables (distribution and labor)
are AUS$1 per bottle and AUS$2 per box.
How is revenue split between the products?
⚫ What types of costs do the products carry, and what are they?
■ What price is being charged for each product? To whom?
Who is the target customer of each product?
■ Are the same grapes being used for both products? Why?
Analysis (Calculations to be completed by interviewee.)
If the grape cost for bottles is AUS$2, for boxes it is AUS$8 (1:4 ratio)
Profit for bottles is AUS$1.5; boxes have a loss of AUS$0.5","The company should try to source grapes of lower cost for its boxed wine product line.
Although the current raw material cost ratio is 1:4 when comparing bottled wine against boxed
wine, the price ratio is only 1:2. We can assume that this is because the bottled line targets a
superior market segment, and boxes cater to businesses that sell wine in bulk. This is another
reason for not maintaining the same quality (and cost) of grapes for both product lines. If raw
material cost for boxed wine could be lowered, even slightly, the line would be profitable.

"Flying to Mango
Increase Revenues
High
Our client is the CEO of a mid-size passenger airline based in Mexico D.F. The airline operates
on the Hub & Spoke model and is seeking to increase its revenue. It intends to do so by
switching the only airplane currently serving the flight to Mango, Brazil (an agricultural
outpost) to their existing New York line service. Is this a good idea?

(Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)
The airplane serving the Brazil line is a Boeing B757 with 200 seats
Only one plane serves the Brazil line, making two round trips a day
The occupancy rate of the Brazil line is 90%
Each round trip ticket to Brazil costs $350
■ The New York line is currently served by 4 planes similar to the Brazil line plane
■ The New York planes each make 3 round trips a day
The occupancy rate of the New York line is 80%
The ticket cost is the same, $350
If an additional plane (and flight) is added to the NY line, occupancy rate will drop to
70%
■ Are costs relevant for this case? (They are not)
What is the revenue generated by each route?
Is there enough demand for NY flights to justify another airplane?
■ Does eliminating the Mango route have any repercussions on other flights to South
America?
Analysis (Calculations to be completed by interviewee.)
Current revenue is $798,000
Brazil 200*2*0.9*$350-126k
126k +672k - 798k
■New revenue would be: $735,000
NY only 200*5*3*0.7*$350","Calculations indicate that eliminating the Mango line would actually decrease overall revenues
of the airline. This is because the occupancy rates for the New York route drops when an extra
airplane is added to that line. In addition, removing the airplane that serves Mango completely
eliminates a highly profitable flight, and may cause service quality repercussions due to
unsatisfied customers.

You have invented a car engine that is fueled by water. What would you do now?

Product
There are no differences in the production costs of a regular gas fueled engine and a water
fueled engine
No differences in performance.
Infrastructure
Gas station can be switched to water easily
Water costs are minimal. How would this impact gas station business models? What are the
implications for sale to a specific company or industry wide? Consider network effects.
What options do you have?
Start a firm and manufacture engines for vehicles (cars, boats, planes, etc)
Think about:
Access to capital
Management capabilities
Sell the patent. To whom? Specific industry: car vs. planes vs. boats, etc. Military vs. private.
How would you price your patent?
This technology is a disruptor. Water engines will completely replace gas engines.
Use car industry as an example. The price of the engine should be equal to the extra profit
derived from the delta price that car manufacturer(s) can apply to a water fueled car. The delta
price that the car manufacturer(s) can apply depends upon a quantification of the lower costs
that customers will face by not having to pay for fuel. In order to determine such number it
may be useful to know:
Size of car market

Assumptions: Revenue is driven by the type of steel, tonnage sold and the price. Changes?
A: We produce three types of steel at Steelco. Details are provided below.
Galvanized
Hot rolled technology
Produced and sold in bulk
Competitive market
Low margins
Production 94: 1MM tons
Production '95: 0.5MM tons
Assumptions:

Low quality
Sold in bulk as scrap
No margin-actually lose $
Output '94: 0.5MM
Output '95: 0.75MM
Based on the production information, it appears as though Steelco has switched its production
priorities to Clear Steel because it has higher margins than Galvanized. But as a result, the
output of Seconds has increased.
Do the increased margins from Clear Steel off-set the loses acquired due to the increase in
seconds. A: How would youfigure it out?
Analysis:
Determine the margins for galvanized and clear steel and the loses associated with Seconds.
Form the equation: [Galv tons x margin] + [Clear tons x margin] [Seconds tons x loses]
This equation would have to be maximized based on the demand for Galvanized and Clear
Additional Information:
Steelco has limited capacity and can only make one type of steel at a time
. It takes twice as long to produce Clear than it does to produce Galvanized
What could you do to improve the process??
Assessment/Recommendations:
The facility was built to produce galvanized steel. In recent years we have switched priorities to
clear steel because it is more profitable. The manufacturing process could be improved.
Increase the batch size and store the inventory at the factory (if possible)
Upgrade the equipment to produce clear steel more efficiently

"American Express has faced strong competition from new credit cards entering

""economics"" of such a decision and should they drop the fee or not?
","SolutionSolution Structure:
Determine how American Express makes money.
Evaluate the pro's and con's of dropping the annual fee.
Make a recommendation
Revenue Drivers
Assumptions:
$50 annual fee multiplied the number of members
No additional revenue from consumers because they pay-off monthly
Receive 1% of the transactions from retailers who honor the AMX card.
Kev Issues:
If the annual fee is dropped, AMX loses ($50) x # of members)
To overcome this loss, they have to increase the revenues from consumer purchases (1% from
the retailer)
■Is it likely that current cardholders will spend more per year if the annual fee is dropped? A:
Not likely. They'd still have to pay off their balance every month.
Therefore, the only way to increase revenues from consumer purchases is to increase the # of
AMX cardholders
Assumptions:
Number of current cardholders-4% of the U.S. population (just a guess):
■ 250MM x 4% = 10MM current cardholders
$50 x 10MM Annual loss of $500MM by dropping the fee.
Current percentage revenue: 10MM members x $1000 annual purchase (avg.).
[10MM (1000x1%)] = $100MM (Estimate of current percentage revenue)
Key Question:
Can we attract enough new members (without a fee) to offset a $500MM loss?
Each new member contributes $10 (1% of $1000 annual purchase).
(500MM/$10) 50MM new members are needed
50MM new members is equivalent to 20% of the population (gut check)
Assessment/Recommendation:
Based on these assumptions, increased membership equivalent to 20% of the population is
probably not likely. Don't drop the fee.
May want to consider varying the fee (sensitivity vs. new members)"

"Our consulting firm has been retained by a major bank to help improve the
profitability of their largest credit card offering. Their card (in the same class
as a Visa or Mastercard) provides average returns in comparison to the
industry, however, our client believes it can become more profitable. You
need to analyze the situation and make recommendations.
","Solution Structure:
Opportunity to decrease costs or increase revenues analyze drivers
Opportunity to vary the annual percentage rate or the annual fee
Benchmark competition for opportunities
Analyze cost and revenue drivers:
Costs
Marketing, SG&A, Personnel - Can't change
Bad credit, theft, etc.-Can't change
Other costs Can't change
Key Issues:
Revenue
Annual fee-currently $50 (Could change)
Annual percentage rate=14% (Could change)
Merchant fee 1.5% (Can't change)
Can't affect the cost structure, therefore have to increase revenues.
Only revenue variables available are changes to the annual fee and APR
Comvetition: Interviewer tells you it is a very competitive environment=""move on"".
Assumption:
Customers use the card differently, there may be different customer segments based on the
balance held, how quickly balances are paid off and the ""need"" for the card.
Case Interviewer suggests there are three distinct categories:
1. Pay-off in full every month
2. Hold small de&t for short periods of time
3. Hold heavy debt for long periods of time (basically pay-off the interest) -80% of our revenue
He/She then asks how you would tailor card services to each of these groups:
Recommendations:
Pay-Off In Full Monthly
Charge high monthly fee
Provide numerous services
(detailed reports, little kudos)
Hold Small Debt Short Term
Increase the APR slightly
Decrease the annual fee
Hold Heaw Debt Long Term
Waive the annual fee
Increase their credit limits
Cash back programs. points
Access to cash advance, etc.
Key Issues;
These heavy debt card holders are the key to our profitability, it is imperative to get them to
sign up for the card (no annual fee), use the card (cash back, point systems) and run up debt
(automatic credit limit increases).
Note to Case Interviewer
. As soon as the interviewee had identified the key drivers of revenue and cost, the focus of the
case was shifted to customer segmentation and tailored services for each segment."
"Our client is a major entertainment company on the west coast. One of their
divisions is a leading home video retailer. During the late '80's and early '90's
this division had a great run-opening 4000 stores and realizing considerable
profits. In the last two years both growth and profit have declined
substantially. You have been brought in by the CEO to assess the situation
and provide recommendations.
Background: Our client's division is not unlike a chain of Blockbuster video
stores. The majority of their business is in movie rental with a much smaller
portion in sales.","Solution Structure:
Start with a simple: (Profit revenue costs) structure
Analyze the competitive situation
Analyze the ""substitution"" factor how else are consumers getting movies?
Costs
Cost of the new movies: (Actually decreased)
Revenues:
# of rentals: (decreased, traffic down)
Price of rental: (No change)
Overhead: (No change)
SG&A: (No change)
Leases, bec. (No change)
Sale of rentals: (decreased)
Accessories: (No change)
Kev Learning:
Cost have actually decreased, but not enough to off-set the decreased store traffic.
Competitive Assessment/Substitutes: (List potential causes of decreased traffic)
New movie stores: (No real change)
New In-home sources cable on demand: (Potential for future but no real current affect)
Sales of movies for home use and collection: (Sales have increased dramatically)
[Once the key issues have been identified, the interviewer describes the changing industry:]
1.When division wus growing, it could buy excess numbers of the new releases to satisfy
customer demand. Later, they would send the excess copies to the new stores us part of their
""library"" of existing tapes. With fewer new stores opening, this is no longer an option■
therefore fewer new releases have been ordered.
2.Recently, the studios have allowed new releases to be sold through warehouse stores (Wall-
Mart) at the sume time they are made available to the rental retailers. Thus, many of our
customers are purchasing rather than renting. In addition, when customers rented a new
release, they quite often rented an existing tape from the Zibruy (additional lost revenue)
Bused on this industry outlook, what would you recommend for the division?
Provide a recap:
It appears as though the major issue facing the division is a reduction in store traffic for new
releases. This is mainly due to the sale of these same releases through alternate channels. How
can we regain store traffic or offset the rental loses?
Recommendations (these are just a few of the options considered
Develop new, more convenient locations kiosks, pick-up/delivery
Develop pricing/bundling formats combining new releases with existing movies
Offer ""rent to buy"" programs rent the first time, then have option to purchase"

Rationale:
To make it easier, start with the larger percentages.
RC doesn't have the economies of scale Coke enjoys, therefore their
manufacturing is a higher percentage of costs.
They do not have as efficient a distribution system (fewer products/same # of
locations), therefore it requires a higher percentage.
Both of these leave less money available for R&D (look at the lack of new
products), marketing and profit.
Overhead is actually lower because they require fewer front-office people to
run the business."
"How long does it take for a baseball to travel from the shortstop to first base in
professional baseball?
","Assumptions:
The base pads are 90 feet apart (you can ask)
The distance from shortstop to fit base is about 120 feet
A major league pitcher can throw about 90-95 mph (you can ask).
A major league shortstop can throw about 80 mph
The key is to be able to convert miles per hour to feet per second.
80 mph to feet/hour:
5280 feet/mile: (80 x 5280) = 422.400 feet/hour
Feet/hour to feet/second:
60 minutes per hour, 60 seconds per minute = 3600 seconds/hour
(422,400/3600) = 117 feet/second
120 feet from short stop to first based. thrown at 117 feet per second =
(120/117) just over a second (1.02 seconds).
Key: Don't be afraid to round off these large numbers:
5000 feet/mile x 80 = 400,000
4000 seconds/minute: 400,000/4000=100 ft/second

"A successful chain of Canadian auto service stores (Autoland) has entered
several markets in the United States in hopes of duplicating their success in
America. The stores offer two services: 1. Retail sales of auto parts for
customers who prefer to perform their own maintenance. 2. A service center
for fixing any automobile problem, from an oil change to new transmission.
Since entering the U.S., Autoland has experienced $50MM in revenue with
loses of $20MM. The owner is considering pulling out of the United States.
You have been hired to determine if they can improve their performance or if
they should exit the market.
Solution Structure:
Analyze the competitive situation
","Analyze the market potential/customer segments
Comoetitive Situation:
What is the competitive situation in Canada? A: We are the major player (few local stores)
Are we providing the same services in Canada as in the U.S. A: Yes
Do we have strong competition in the U.S.
A: Yes, a national chain of stores in the exact format as Autoland exists in the US. They
basically copied our Canadian format and have about 10 locations in every major city. Thy
are very profitable in all cities including our U.S. markets.
Assumptions: Due to size. I would guess they have superior buying power over Autoland in
the U.S. Is this true? A: No, we have the same cost structure due to our presence in Canada.
Assumption: The market has potential due to the competitor's performance. Key is to
determine why they are out-performing Autoland.
Autoland Capabilities:
Assumption: We actually have two businesses under one roof. is one more profitable than the
other? A: In Canada ▪no. But in the U.S. we are profitable in retail sales and losing heavily on
the service center.
Are the costs associated with each side of the business different? A: Yes, the service center is
much more expensive to operate, we have to pay mechanics and have high fixed costs.
Assumption: We are profitable in retail, but losing in service. We attract the wrong consumer.
Market/Customers:
Autoland provides two services, are the customers for each service different?
A: Yes. The customers that shop for retails parts typically have lower to middle incomes and
are trying to save a few dollars by performing their own maintenance. The customers who
utilize the service center have higher incomes and no interest infixing their own car.
Assumption: We are attempting to attract two distinct customer segments. Are we doing this
successfully? A: We are not sure, how would you help us determine if we are?
Factors:
Marketing.
Pricing.
Location.
A: We do the same as the competition
A: Identical to competition
A: Different, we located in the inner cities to save mon y on leases.
Where is the competition located? A: Between the inner city and the suburbs (on the border)
Assump tions /Recommendations
Our location is great for the retail sales business, but prohibits heavy use of the service center
due the distribution of income between the inner city vs. the suburbs.
In new markets, locate between the lower and upper income areas to attract both segments.
In existing markets, move, or drop the service business and retain the profitable retail portion"
"A lingerie manufacture in New Zealand (Vicki's Gossip) has had the luxury of
being the only provider of lingerie to the New Zealand market due to
extremely high tariffs on imports. Currently, the tariff is 50% of total cost to

This year, the New Zealand Government decided to decrease the import tariff
by 5% a year for the next ten years. Vicki's Gossip is concerned that this
change will drastically affect their business. What is your assessment of the
situation and how could you help Vicki's protect their situation?

Assess the current costs structure within Vicki's
Assess the competitive situation
Determine the affect of the reduced tariff based on these cost structures.
Provide a comprehensive assessment and recommendations
Cost Driver Assumptions:
Labor, raw materials, design, manufacturing, distribution, SG&A, Overhead
A: The average cost of an item made by Vicki's is $10.
■ 50% of the cost is labor related and 50% is made-up of all other costs
Key Issue
Vicki's production is extremely labor intensive = $5/item
Competitive Assessment Assumotions:
Assume similar cost drivers. Do we know the break-out of competitive costs?
A: Per item: $1 for Labor, $2 shipping to New Zealand, $5 all other
Key Learning:

competition over these thirty years comes from Joe's cheese company, which
also produces very high quality cheese.
These two competitors have had a friendly rivalry over time and each holds
about 30% share of market. Recently, Frank and Joe have seen their profits
drop. Frank blames the decline in profits on increased advertising and
promotional spending.
You have just a few minutes to determine if Frank is correct and suggest
solutions. How do you proceed.","Solution Structure:
Quick check for changes to the costs or revenues
Analysis of competition, Joe and other
Analysis of other potential problems
Costs Driver Assumptions:
Any changes in: Dairy products (raw materials), production costs, distribution costs, marketing
costs, other?
A: No major changes except for a considerable increase in promotional costs (couponing and
retail price reductions).
Revenue Driver Assumptions:
Any changes in Price, number of accounts, sales levels, type of cheese sold, quality of cheese?
A: Have taken periodic price reductions. No other major changes
Assumptions:
Frank has increased promotional spending and reduced prices. Most likely due to an increase
in competitive pressure. Have we seen increased competition?
A: Yes, many of our accounts are offering private label cheese at half our retail price
What do we know about the private label cheese? Quality?, Consumers?
A: Lower quality than Frank's. Two consumer segments: Those who do a lot of home cooking
and use only Frank's or Joe's. Those who just stop in and pick-up a block of cheese.
Why have we been discounting? Are we losing our loyal consumers?
A: No. We're just under a lot of pressurefrom the retailer to match prices
Issues
Due to competitive pressure from private label. Frank and Joe have taken periodic price
reductions. This has hurt their margins and may also cause them to lose their loyal customers
(lose high quality brand image).
Recommendations:
Maintain premium price levels for Frank's current line of high quality cheese.
Manufacture a lower cost product under a different brand name to compete with private label
brands..
Utilize advertising revenues to communicate the benefit of using high quality cheese"
"OPTICAL FIBRES 
Our client makes optical fibre (has volume advantages to copper wire) which is mainly used by
the telecom, cable and mobile phone industries. It's made in glass strands and rolled onto 25 km
spools. Their customers (who are generally major Telecoms networks) would buy a huge
quantity, bundle it up, dig a trench and put the bundle of fibres in the ground. They've seen a
50% decline in revenues, and have recently brought in a new CEO. The new CEO would like to
know:
a) Why did revenues drop 50% in one year?
b) Can he expect an improvement, and if so in what timeframe?
c) How does our company compare to our competitors?
Optical fibre is similar to a commodity, so consumers do not purchase by brand and pricing is in
line with competition.
There has been no significant change in supply from the company's perspective.
There are no direct substitutes and no regulation changes during this period.
The ""usage"" of the optical fibres, for voice, data and internet, has actually doubled each year.
(meaning you would think you'd actually need twice as much each year)
Customers are asking for less.
No major changes in customer's industry. Even spread across industries for product sales.
Current usage is 5 T/second, but capacity is 100 T/second.","Why did revenues drop 50% in one year?
I determined the problem was that because it is such an effort and expense to dig the trenches to put
the fibre bundles in, the customer does it as infrequently as possible which leads to overcapacity.
Can he expect an improvement? If so when?
I found out that they buy a year in advance of needing it. Since usage doubled yearly, I worked out
that customers would reach capacity in 3.5 years, and therefore we would be impacted for 2.5 years.
The CEO wants a benchmark slide with how we compare to our competitors: what would be the
main items you'd want to see on that slide?
I asked for Market Share (leader), Cost (lowest cost), People (no advantage), Customer Base (no
advantage), Product (no real advantage), and Balance Sheet (highest)
He asked if we could weather the storm or if we were in trouble.
I said if we had a pretty healthy financial situation, we could weather the storm for 2.5 years but that it
would be worthwhile looking for other ways to diversify since this would be a cyclic problem.
The key to answering this question is understanding what is actually going on in the industry.
To get to the heart of this issue you could ask:
Clearly our client has lost a significant portion of their revenue. To understand why there are three key
things I would want to examine.
First, what has changed about our Client - we haven't heard of any major reason why things
would be going wrong internally but some of the things that I would want to look at are: Have
they lost key sales personnel with good customer relationships? Have they lost their good
reputation because of some incident or accident etc? Have there been perceived quality
problems? Etc
⚫ Second, I would want to look at our key Competitors - Are they offering a better product?
(probably not if the industry is commoditized) Are they selling at a lower price? Are they
offering better service/delivery times etc? Are there now more competitors? Are our
competitors better placed geographically to meet the needs of our customers? Are their some
competitors that are doing better than us? If so how do they differ from us? Are they bigger
and leveraging their scale, etc?
. Third, I would want to look at the needs of our Customers and whether these have changed. -
If there is nothing wrong with our product (Client) and our Competitors haven't suddenly got
better then the downturn in sales must have something to do with the needs of our Customers.
What is their current usage? What is their current capacity? What is their anticipated usage?
What are their purchasing patterns relative to capacity? etc
This structure should drive you to identify the key issue. The way the facts are presented it looks like
most of the questions on Client and Competitors will yield little return and the richest part of the
discussion will focus around Customer needs. This should provide the opportunity to discover all of
the facts about the growth in demand and the capacity constraint currently in place. It could also lead
to understanding the ""lumpy"" nature of these capital purchases.
This discussion should also draw out enough information to answer the follow up question on how our
client compares to its competitors.

"HOLDING COMPANY 
Client is a holding company or conglomerate. They are a longstanding client of ours. Their
revenues are about 1.5B/year. They hold all sorts of companies, mostly around low tech
manufacturing, including roughly in the ""Oil and Gas"" ""Automotive"" and ""other"" categories.
The holding company doesn't really have a unified portfolio, but basically places bets on
companies it acquires. It is now looking at an auto parts manufacturer, and trying to get an idea
of whether it should acquire it.
What kind of things would you want to investigate to find out whether it was a good idea?
Financial health is excellent - sitting on a lot of cash. Their portfolio is well diversified. They are
not looking for ""synergies"" necessarily.
After market products - winches for cars, trucks, ATV's (revenues of 300M for this product line).
They have 90% of the market in the US, and the market is expected to have flat growth.
Second division is drive train mechanism for switching car from 2W drive to 4W drive. It's a
small niche market, mostly luxury cars.","What were some options for the Winch products since the market in the US seemed tapped out?
We talked about markets not really existing in other geographies because it was mainly ATVs and
they weren't as common in other countries. We talked about leveraging the technology and although
nothing else could be made with it, they did discover a use as a ""tool"" for home and shop use (to lift
bricks etc).
Who would the customers be here?
We talked about small contractors and home use consumers (do it yourself) I asked where they
shopped and it turned out that small contractors shopped mainly at wholesalers and big box shops like
Home Depot. The trend was moving towards big box. These shops only renew their contracts once a
year with manufacturers.
How would you figure out margins for Home Depot?
We talked about how margins were based on margin/square foot and that you could ask for a small
space, but keep it extremely well stocked at all times and keep our packaging small.
How would you bring in customers in this entirely new market?
Advertising through do it yourself channels on TV, magazines, in-store demos. (this apparently didn't
work as well b/c they had to send people to 350 stores to do the demos and for a small company it was
too much).
He then wanted to talk about sales in the Drive Train component area:
I asked about consumers, and we talked about consumers being both end consumers and auto
manufacturers. I asked how often cars were redesigned and he said every 4-5 years, but the trend was
going down towards every 3 years.
What does this tell us?
The opportunity to get in a redesign is better.
What does this tell us about the future as this time continues to go down? Is this an advantage?
I said no, because now you will likely have more competitive pressure from those who saw this as a
barrier.
Lastly, he wanted to know how I would evaluate the overall deal tactically.
I talked about doing some sort of return on investment calculation to make sure the return was
adequate, and that the results we needed in a particular time frame existed.
My concern in this case would be that the interviewee hasn't developed a clear set of criteria for
assessing the potential acquisition and used these to drive through the case in a structured fashion.
There are a number of potential approaches but I would probably break it down as follows:
⚫ Before anything else I would ask for some more information on the potential target's business.
What products do they sell? What are their revenues and margins? Etc. Then I would analyze
whether this makes the acquisition desirable by looking at the following:
First I would want to look at whether this is an attractive industry to be getting into
generally - The automotive parts industry seems to be generally consistent with the
other products in their portfolio so I would assume that they probably have the skills to
manage this sort of business, is that correct? I would also want to look at the growth
prospects for this industry. Is the automotive parts industry expected to grow faster or
slower than other low tech industry companies they may also choose to invest in?
Second I would want to examine whether this is the right company within the
automotive parts industry to buy - in particular I would want to know to what extent
our client could derive value from the acquisition. Will there be any synergies with the
other companies that our client owns? Will our client be able to improve profitability
by driving costs out of this business? Are there opportunities to increase sales or grow
the business faster than existing management is predicting?
Finally I would want to consider these potential improvements from a financial
perspective. Does the client have a certain NPV or ROE target that it is looking to
achieve before it invests?"
"ELECTION 
What do you think is going to happen after the election if Kerry wins and Drug Reimportation
from Canada is legalized? I'd like to know what you think the impact will be to Lipitor (Pfizer)
and if it's negative, how we can mitigate it.
In the US, the Lipitor market is $7B.
Lipitor is manufactured in Puerto Rico.
Drug reimportation is not currently legal, so is mostly conducted via the internet.","What is the impact?
I broke it up into a short term revenue impact and a long term impact on the pharma large margin
model. I drew the value chain for the drug model:
Pharmaco, PBM-Pharmacy Benefit Manager (negotiates price)
Pharmacy (sells)
Consumer (buys)
In between you have the Doctor talking to the pharmacy and the health plan ultimately picking up the
tab. We established that the healthplans will be pushing for this, and the PBMs will put pressure on the
Pharmacos as the gatekeeper to the contracts with health plans.
What will be the financial effect?
I asked what the pricing was currently. It is sold for $70 per month, and we were looking at $30 per
month for the same drug in Canada. That meant the $7B would be $4B less. Big effect!
What can Pfizer to do mitigate?
I asked if there were drugs that they sold in the US but not in Canada - there are. This is an option -
they can bump margins on those products. They can lower costs (they should already be doing this but
b/c their margins are so big, it's not a priority). They can also limit the amount of cheaper drug output
to match the Canadian market size (ie. since Canada's pop is 10% of US, they can release less and
limit the market for the ""reimported"" drugs) I also suggested pushing for longer contracts with the
PBMS so that we could extend past patent life of Lipitor and keep margins, but he asked if the PBMs
would have to allow that. They would also know when they were coming off patent, so would likely
not sign those types of contracts.
Booz and some of the industry specialist consulting firms will often ask case questions that are
industry specific and require you to demonstrate your industry knowledge.
A Bain, BCG or McKinsey is extremely unlikely to ever expect you to have this level of knowledge
about a particular market before the start of a case but they can still be used as reasonable practice
cases."
"PERPETUAL MOTION  
NEW PRODUCT/MARKET ENTRY
I was flying back from my client the other night, and working away on my laptop. Beside me
was seated a mad scientist, who engaged me in conversation, and was excited to find out I was a
consultant. It seems that he has created a perpetual motion machine. It requires no energy, and
keeps on going. He wants to know how to make money with it.
No additional information provided","We started with a general framework on the things I would cover. She pushed me into the category
of what it might be used for and we stuck on cars.
She asked me what the size of the opportunity could be.
I did a quick market sizing, based on the # of cars in the US, and what % I would guess are traditional
fuel vs. alternative fuel (a small %) and then assumed a % of those bought new cars yearly and ended
up with a large #. (40B, I think)
What would convince these people to buy our technology in their cars?
I talked about value proposition, pricing, awareness, proof of technology.
How would we convince the traditional fuel customers to buy this?
*no response provided
How would you price this? And how would this change over time?
I talked about making sure we covered our COGS, and then looked at EVC especially in terms of
actual fuel costs and time spent refueling, environmental feel good factor etc. I thought that initially
we'd price at a premium and later in the life cycle when it was more mature, I figured we'd potentially
be competing on price since other alternatives may creep in.
What would GM think of this if we were to approach them with it?
I talked about how they would probably be thinking about the fact that their bread and butter business
(traditional fuel) would be threatened, but ultimately they would need to decide whether they thought
the competitors would come out with this before them, or whether they would want to be the first to
market with it. I also talked about how it may take a while to implement because of operational
difficulties, design etc.
Would you invest with the Mad Scientist, if he asked you to? Why?
What is your 30 second elevator speech to Warren Buffet?
Looking at the potential to use this technology in cars is clearly a great option and the case approach
that the interviewee went through looks pretty good.
Starting from a more generic level however I would probably tackle the question as follows:
If we look at the benefits of a perpetual motion machine, it is basically a source of energy. In assessing
potential applications of the technology then I would ask the question ""Where is there the greatest
demand for energy?"" or ""Where is the best market for a new source of energy?""
This could lead to a reasonable discussion of a number of different options: energy at home, energy in
industry, energy in transport. Transport makes sense as a market to drill down on this product because
it is clearly such a large source of energy consumption.
From a pricing perspective you may need to think about the price of the technology as against the
savings that it generates. You would need to ensure there was still sufficient savings to justify
consumers wishing to try a new technology. Equally it would be important that the mad scientist
prices the product so that car manufacturers can implement the technology profitably.
30 second speech:
This is a source of limitless energy. As energy demand continues to grow it becomes a more and more
precious resource. Who would not want to invest in a limitless source of a precious resource?"
"NUTRACORP 
Nutracorp is a $5B nutrition foods company based in France. They have a broad EU presence
and have excellent market share in France, Germany, and Spain. They have two lines of
products: Premium Infant Products, which includes milk and solid foods for infants up to 2
years old. These are sold through the retail channel. Medical nutrition supplements, which are
for sick patients (HIV, Cancer, Diabetes), and are basically a pill or powder that help the patient
recover their strength. These are sold through the Direct Sales Channel.
The CEO feels that the growth potential for this company has maxed out in Europe. We'd like
to explore the US Market.
Since this is a McKinsey structured case, and would be most valuable given in that style, it is
written up that way so people get use to the choppiness.","1. What are the key areas you would explore to determine whether this is a good idea?
I basically talked through my own personal framework for market entry, which included the internal
aspects: capabilities, channel/supplier relationships, customers (are they the same), and profitability as
well as industry things like: the growth rate and size of the US market, the competitors and regulatory
issues.
2. a) Now let's talk about the medical nutritional food supplements for the Diabetic Market. How
would you go about sizing this market? Patients take 2 supplements per day, and they cost $1.50
per supplement. Go ahead and estimate it.
(Additional information provided if asked: 5% prevalence rate, 90% compliance rate)
300 M in the US, 5% prevalence gives 15 M people with diabetes, 90% of them take these
supplements, gives 13.5M, x 1.5 $/supp x 2 supp/day x 365 days gives about $14.8B for a market
estimate.
b) How could we grow this market?
Would be driven by raising compliance (small effect); prevalence of diabetes in population; increase
in dosage price or amount.
c) How would the competitors in the US react to us entering the market?
I probably missed some, but I used increase in sales force, differentiating/positioning their product as
better, blocking channels, more dollars to advertising.
3) Which channel do you think makes the most sense for them to go after as they enter? Here I was
given a chart that looked like the one attached on the next page.*
Specialty Retailers seemed to be right answer, but I can't recall what I said, and to this day am not
sure what the reasons are. He explicitly said this is not a quantitative question.

Interviewee's Solution (cont.):
4) Switching gears again to the medical nutrition products - let's talk about Cancer patients. How
many cancer patients would we need to attract to our product to break even? We have 50 Sales Reps
$10M budget for PR, our direct costs are 80% and assume they take 2 doses per day for 5 months
out of a year.
Additional information provided if requested:
.
Sales reps salaries are $100K/year, plus $100K in benefits. The price of a dose is $1.
I did a breakeven that looked like:
10M+(200K 50 reps) = (2doses *5 months 30 days * 20% *S1)* # of pts and ended up with # of
pts = 330K
5) The CEO would like your recommendation of your suggestions, based on what you learned today
as well as any other ideas you have to add.
*no response provided
Different interviewers, not just different firms, can have very different styles of interviewing and much
of this comes down to mood or personality so it is definitely worthwhile making sure you are prepared
for interviews that are more like an interrogation as well as interviews where you get to take the lead.
Remember also that, although they may be firing questions at you, you still need to be thinking about
how you can demonstrate an understanding of the complete set of issues. Don't just answer the
question, but also think about how you can set out a structure around your answer.
The interviewee's response to the first question is a good example of this. They have laid out a set of
issues that they would want to explore in determining whether this is a good market to enter. There is
no one structure for this question and a number of different approaches would be equally acceptable.
You may want to do a Porter's Five forces analysis of the US market and overlay a comparison of
other international markets that may be more attractive - for example, are their higher prevalence rates
in Asia? Or a greater propensity to pay?
The candidate appeared to have difficulties with question number 3. This question could potentially be
approached by asking two questions:
Firstly I would want to determine where we can get the biggest bang for our buck - that is,
which sales channel gets us the best access to the market per client. The answer appears to
be overwhelmingly the Mass Retailers where 10 chains give us access to a $10.5B market.
(Note there may be an inconsistency here as both specialty retailers and mass retailers are
listed as 40% but with very different sales numbers).
• Next I would want to consider whether there are any factors limiting or complicating
access to my preferred channel - On its face the mass retail channel looks like the best
because it has a very high sales number for a very small number of clients (10 chains). We
would need to know however what the restrictions on accessing this channel are. Mass
retailers may charge a premium for shelf space making this an extremely expensive option.
Alternatively mass retailers may carry only a small number of well known brands making it
almost impossible for new entrants to gain access until they have established a reputation in
the specialty retailers that carry more brands etc.
A good answer would involve at least identifying these potential issues"
"PARTY GOODS
Our client is a manufacturer of party goods. They have two product portfolios: everyday and
seasonal. Everyday products pertain to occasions that happen throughout the year such as
birthdays and anniversaries. Seasonal goods are for occasions such as the 4th of July or
Thanksgiving. They have a design facility that comes out with different party themes and takes
care of licensing for goods using characters like Mickey Mouse or Shrek. They also have a
manufacturing and distribution facility and a sales force that provides support to retailers.
One of their large and new customers came to management complaining that their prices are
too high. They claimed that this is due to high distribution costs. After some analysis, the client
found this to be true. We have been asked to figure out how we can decrease distribution costs.

Additional Information Provided (spreadsheet):

Less than Truckload - fill part of truck with goods up to 500 boxes per truck, costs $1000 per truck, makes only one stop
Sample Computation:
For Everyday Months:
Use UPS for Zones 1 and 2 where Cost per month less than $1000 1400
Use less than truckload for Zones 3, 4, 5 3000
Total Monthly Cost 4400
Cost Savings per Month 600
For Everyday and Seasonal Months:
Use Truckload for all Zones since truckload cost of $1500 is less than UPS cost per month 7500
Cost Savings per Month 12500
Total Annual Cost Savings 54800","Interviewee: I first need to understand the distribution process and cost breakdown. Then, I want to
benchmark against competitors and find out what they are doing in terms of distribution. Then,
based on the info, I want to figure out what the best alternatives are for our client.
Interviewer: That's a good framework. Let's start with costs. What do you think are the costs related
to distribution?
Interviewee: Labor, Trucks, Sorting machines, OH, freight etc. I went through the entire value chain
and identified costs.
Interviewee's Solution (cont.):
Interviewer: Here's a breakdown of freight costs. They use UPS to distribute goods. (Explains table
attached) What do you think?
Interviewee: I'd like to get more information about other suppliers, the geographic concentration of
our customers and seasonal volume.
Interviewer: Other competitors use a mix of UPS and trucks to distribute goods. (See spreadsheet
for more info) How do you think we can save during our everyday months? How about during the
seasonal/everyday months?
Interviewee: (computes cost difference and savings)
Interviewer: You're meeting with the CEO tomorrow. How will you summarize your findings?
Interviewer: There's great opportunity to save using a combination of UPS and truckload services.
From our initial computations we can save as much as $54,800 annually. (see computation)
This case is relatively straightforward and, if you can do the math, then the case should practically
solve itself.
The key to being successful is to ensure that you ask the right questions upfront to obtain all of the
necessary information to calculate the cost savings and that you then logically and thoroughly drive
through those calculations.
The candidate has done a pretty good job of that here, first asking about the distribution process and
about the alternatives used by competitors to elicit information before starting the calculations.
If you are good with numbers then these cases can be a little boring as you are never called on to do
anything really creative and you will probably never feel out of your depth. That is not necessarily a
bad thing however as there is probably very little risk of you going too far wrong.
If you are not good at math, then this will be a good practice question. It is essential that you get to the
point where you are proficient and comfortable in analyzing data and running a series of computations
to calculate cost savings or profit improvements. These questions are not uncommon."
"CPG - RAZORS & BLADES (BCG - Round 1) MARKET SEGMENTATION
Our client is a global CPG company, with multiple lines of business (toothpaste, batteries, hair
care, etc). They are the global market leader in every market they play in, and have come to us
specifically asking how they can grow their share in the razors and blades market. What do you
tell them?
Market is divided by wet-shaving and dry-hair removal (e.g. waxing, electric, etc).
Wet shaving is divided into cartridge-systems and disposables in shaving. Client has 70% of the
men's shaving market; 35% of the women's cartridge-system market.","Thru some basic math on sheets she gave me but then kept; I determined that Client has 50 of every
100 women who wet-shave; but only 35/100 of all women who remove hair. Certain countries had
different attitudes; people along coasts were more likely to remove hair than in middle of countries. 4
reasons that women weren't wet-shaving:
⚫ Fear of being cut
⚫ Wet shaving considered a chore
Masculine - shaving not seen as feminine
Shaving considered ""lower class""
BCG took these reasons & implemented various marketing programs to change consumer perception
& improve % of total market that client had.
We are not given a lot of information from the actual interviewee so I would recommend using the
following data to flesh out the detail of the case as needed:
Percentage of men who use hair removal products regularly: 95%
Percentage of men who shave as their primary form of hair removal: 90%
Client's share of men's shaving market: 70% (70% of disposables and 70% of cartridges)
Percentage of women who use hair removal products regularly: 90%
Percentage of women who shave as their primary form of hair removal: 70%
Client's share of women's shaving market: 50% (35% of cartridges and 65% of disposables)
Disposable systems cost on average half the amount per shave as cartridge systems.
Cartridge shaving costs on average half the amount per hair removal as dry-hair removal.
Case recipients should then have to ask relevant questions to extract this data. An analysis could then
determine that there is little room for growth in the men's market and the client would need to focus
on growing its share in the women's market.
Potential strategies to explore would include:
Grow the total women's market - encourage more women to shave
⚫ Grow market share (especially cartridge share) - encourage existing customers to migrate from
cheaper disposables to more expensive cartridge systems
• Increase price - introduce marketing aimed at shifting the image of shaving up-market to
enable the client to sell at a higher price. i.e. address the price discrepancy between wet & dry."
"SUPERMARKET 
Our client is a supermarket in the UK. They've been the market leader for 50+ years; however
in the past 3 years they have seen growth stall, and an upstart take their market share. They are
now at 30% market share & flat growth. What's wrong? How do you help them fix the
problem?
Costs: COGS = 60%; Maintenance = 9-10%; Labor = 15%; Marketing / Distribution= 2%
Competitor growing @6%/year
Simplified visual of a store aisle with 30 ft. for Bread, 10 ft. for Hair Gel, 20 ft. for frozen meals
& 20 ft. for Canned Tomatoes, with unit volumes, revenue & profits","Thru simple calculations, if you shifted 10 ft. of shelf-space from Bread to higher-margin Hair Gel,
you might have higher profits of $30/week/aisle.
*$50 average basket size = $1500 * 20 aisles/store = 30,000; 500 stores in UK=15,000,000 * P/E
ratio of 10=150 million extra profit; and we're talking real money here, from a simple aisle-
optimization!
Interviewee Notes:
Demand elasticity was a significant factor here. I nailed that; but failed to calculate some #s properly.
Actual Outcome of the Case:
Upstart competitor had figured out optimal shelf-space issue by optimizing:
1. Elasticity of sales to shelf-space
2. Consumers changing demands towards prepared foods
3. Competitive offerings.
*Client supermarket had to figure out the same & put into their own cost/reality model to make this
work.
There are a number of potential issues that the interviewer could be looking for you to analyze here
and this is a situation where it is important that you have a good structure to systematically work
through the options.
I would be concerned that leaping in and analyzing the margins on shelf space doesn't necessarily
cover off all the issues - it also may not explain why one company is growing and the other is not.
I would approach this question as follows:
⚫ First, I would like to understand the differences between our client's offering and that of our
competitors to determine the drivers of our competitors' growth.
⚫ Then, once we understand the factors driving their growth I would like to explore the ways in
which our client could modify its strategy to increase its growth rate.
Looking firstly at the differences between our client and our competitors. I would like to know
the following:
What is the relative market share of each of our competitor's and how has this been
growing?
What is the difference between the products and services we offer and those offered by
our competitors?
Do they offer different categories of products?
In which categories have their sales been growing?
In what offer ways are our competitors differentiated from us?
Have they been opening more stores?
■ Are their stores in areas that have a faster growing population?
Do they target a demographic segment that has been growing?
Are they growing sales through altemate channels (e.g. online)
Hopefully from asking these questions you would get some information as to the higher margins that
competitors are earning by stocking different product ranges and an analysis of the profitability
improvements resulting from this change could follow.
If you are giving this case as an interviewer I recommend that you think through prepared answers to
the questions set out above to give the case more life. Exactly what answers you give doesn't matter
provided they drive the candidate to the conclusion that margin by product category is an important
difference.

"CHEWING GUM (AT Kearney - Round 1)
PROFITABILITY
Client is a chewing gum manufacturer. Analysts' reports are giving our client's stock poor
ratings. We want to figure out what's going on.
Our client makes all varieties of gum-sugar, sugar-free, whitening, etc.
Revenues have remained constant, though profit has decreased.","I first looked deeper in profit decreasing issue. It turns out that lower profit margin gum has been
selling more while higher profit margin gum has been selling less, which explains the profit loss.
Gum flavor is the most significant cost factor (the cost structure was broken down into gum base,
flavors, chemicals, and sugar for me). The issue was that a flavor can only be used for gum, so even
though the gum manufacturers were much smaller than the flavor producers, the gum manufactures
had the ""power"" once the flavor producer created the flavor. The flavor had to be sold or it would
go bad.
Our client could create an exclusivity deal with a flavor producer and agree to buy the flavor
producer's entire flavor for a reduced price, benefiting both parties in the agreement.
By far one of the most common types of case interview questions you will receive is one requiring you
to analyze changes in profitability. Once you have done a few of these you will recognize that they can
all be approached in a fairly similar fashion.
A similar approach can be applied to most profitability questions. The simple structure is:
Identify as a profitability issue
•
Analyze revenue issues
Analyze cost issues
⚫Identify cause of profitability decline
⚫ Outline options to address cause of decline
⚫ Select a preferred option
⚫ Explore other ways that profitability might be improved generally (if any)
Applying that approach to the specifics of this case I would probably answer it as follows:
""I am assuming that if analysts are giving our stocks poor ratings that is either because profitability
has been declining or because profitability is forecast to decline in the future, is that correct?"" (expect
interviewer to say yes, profitability has been declining)
""If that is the case then, in coming up with a recommendation for the client, I would want to explore
the potential causes of that decline. Given, that profitability is revenue minus costs; I'd like to start by
looking at what has been happening on the revenue side to see if this is the cause of declining
profitability and then move to costs, examining each of the different cost components for our client to
see where there have been significant increases."" (expect interviewer to say that sounds OK)
""So do we have any information as to what has been happening on the revenue side"" (expect this to
get shut down as an avenue when they say that revenue is constant)
""Well if revenues are constant but profits are declining then that must mean that costs have been
increasing. Do we have any information on what elements of cost have been going up"" (your
interviewer may ask you to outline what you think the major cost components would be or they may
give this to you. Eventually you will get to the fact that gum flavor is the most significant component
and that flavoring costs have been going up because your client has been selling more of the flavored
gum (which has higher cost and lower margin)
""OK, having identified that the most significant cause of the cost increase is that we are now selling
more of the flavored gum, and that flavoring carries a significant cost, I would like to turn to looking
at how we can improve our clients profitability by reducing this cost"" (if you have missed a major cost
bucket at this point the interviewer will probably correct you by asking if there is anything else you
think you should look at first)
""In looking at potential cost savings I would like to explore the following alternatives:
Can we use less flavoring? Would sales actually be affected if we simply put less of the
flavoring component into our mix?
Are there cheaper sources of flavoring? Could we save money by using a different supplier?
What are the alternatives?
⚫ Could we negotiate a better deal from our existing supplier? Could we get better terms by
agreeing to exclusivity arrangements? Or perhaps consolidating orders to a smaller number of
larger batches?
Depending on the interviewer's responses and the information available you should be able to drive to
a conclusion and recommendation.
In reaching this recommendation it may be worth noting that we could also explore marketing non-
flavored gum more heavily to try to shift consumer preferences back to gum where we earn a higher
margin? Or perhaps we could look at restoring our margin on flavored gum by raising the price of
flavored gum?"" (These alternatives are unlikely to be realistic if the market is highly competitive - as
we would expect, but they may be worth mentioning for completeness)"
"ALCOHOL DISTRIBUTION  
SUPPLY CHAIN
The client is a US market-leading alcohol manufacturer. They are considering restructuring
their distribution strategy and want to know if they should have one or 50 distribution centers.
Distribution centers lie in between the bottling plants (all over the US) and the customers.
Customers are the spirits retailers.","I drew a list of advantages of 1 versus 50 distribution centers:
Advantages of 1: cost of location/real estate; cost of labor in warehouse; less inventory needed (less
deviation of demand); better management/infrastructure efficiencies; costs of breakage lower (less
moving, less ""bumps,"" fewer breakage opportunities).
Advantage of 50: reduced risk (fire in one distribution center and you have serious problems if that's
the only center); less time involved in order process.
I then drew a map of the United States and determined transportation costs would be less.
Twist added: Given to me that the total cost of 50 distribution centers would be $600MM while total
cost of 1 distribution center would be $500MM, but CFO still decided to go with 50 distribution
centers. I was asked why I think he went with that decision.
Conversation included hedging risk is a huge factor not easily quantifiable, but that customer service
(proximity to customers makes response faster) would result in more loyal customers and result in
higher acquisition and retention rates of customers.
I would analyze this case using the following framework:
Our client should adopt whichever distribution network is the most profitable unless there are
compelling risk factors or long term strategic issues that demand otherwise. So in making the decision
there are three primary areas we need to explore:
⚫ Costs - what are the incremental costs associated with using 50 distribution centers instead of
one central warehouse..
。 What are the transitional costs or one-time set up costs associated with moving away
from the existing distribution network?
What are the real estate/plant costs associated with running 50 warehouses?
Presumably this is significantly more than having one enormous warehouse.
What are the transportation costs associated with running 50 separate warehouses?
Presumably running 50 warehouses creates some savings because each of the routes is
far shorter than if we only have one national warehouse but there may be some
interesting issues if running 50 warehouses means we are not operating at scale.
What are the personnel costs associated with 50 warehouses? Presumably this would
involve significantly more staff and we would have a duplication of functions that
could be avoided by operating one warehouse?
What are the capacity/stock keeping costs? Pooling resources normally enables
smoothing of demand fluctuations. We anticipate that the total inventory held at all 50
warehouses would be higher than if fluctuations could be smoothed by using only one
warehouse.
Revenue - what is the net revenue impact from expanding the number of distribution centers?
。 Will we be better able to service our customers' needs by having 50 distribution centers
and therefore be able to increase demand and sales revenue?
Will having a ""local"" presence enhance the image or reputation of the firm and help
increase sales.
Will we have a better understanding of market conditions by having employees on the
ground in 50 locations and therefore operate in a more responsive fashion helping to
increase sales.
Strategic/Risk Factors - are there factors that cannot easily be quantified in the revenue and
cost analysis that make one structure more preferable.
What is our exposure if there is a fire in our one warehouse?
What is our exposure if there is a local transport strike that affects our one warehouse?
Similarly what if there is an adverse weather event e.g. snowstorm that impacts our one
distribution center?
From a strategic perspective are we better off having 50 centers so that we can more
rapidly respond and grow in one area if necessary?
Do we need 50 centers because this is what competitors do and this is what our
customers will expect/demand?
Do we need 50 centers from an internal cost monitoring perspective? e.g. the 50 centers
can be benchmarked against each other. Best practices rolled out across the whole
system. Inefficiency may be less visible if there is only one center."
"GAS STATION 
Estimate the number of gas stations in the city of Chicago.
MARKET SIZING
1) Think about all the ways you would go about estimating this and describe them
2) Choose one method and do the estimate
3) Second part of case he asked me to think about if a friend of mine wanted to open a gas
station in Chicago, what things would I suggest my friend consider?
None provided","Estimate was mostly done by me with little input by my interviewer. I used Philadelphia as a
benchmark and tried to figure the number of gas stations per block and then estimated the number of
blocks. I know a lot of people estimated the number of gallons of gas a gas station would hold, the
number of gallons of gas a car/truck can hold, the number of cars/trucks in and out of the city
considering weekday commuting and delivering and weekend travel and then estimated how many gas
stations would be required to meet the needs of the cars/trucks/etc.
For the second part of the interview, I mentioned that my friend should take into consideration the
volume of traffic in the area, the number of gas stations in the area (brand names vs. his no-name gas
station), residential vs. commercial area - will he sell diesel fuel for trucks?, cross-selling by having a
market as well, etc.
There are a number of ways to go about this estimation and to a certain degree they may be governed
by the amount and type of information that the interviewer is prepared to make available.
A good recommendation for any estimation question however
estimated or externally verified.
choose divisions that may be easily
The approaches suggested above are both valid. An alternative however would be as follows:
⚫Estimate the number of people in Chicago and estimate the number of people per car
Gives the number of cars in Chicago
Estimate the total gallons of gas used per car per year
⚫ Gives the total number of gallons of gas used in Chicago.
⚫If you can get an estimate of the average gallons sold by a service station in a year use this
to get estimated number of service stations in Chicago
(Alternatively if you can't get the number of gallons sold per year you could estimate as follows:
What is the average number of customers per day
What is the average volume of one sale (average tank size)
(Gives an estimate of the average sales per store.)
The second part of the case opens a general discussion of the attractiveness of an industry or a
business.
A good response should discuss the attractiveness of the industry:
What are the margins (low)
What is the intensity of competition (high- this is a commoditized product)
⚫ What is the power of supplier (high- they are massive multinational oil companies)
What is the power of buyers (high- people can easily drive to a different petrol station)
⚫ Substitutes - not many (walking or riding) - but this isn't really a significant consideration
Overall assessment should be that this is a difficult industry and therefore should only go into it is
there is a good individual opportunity. In assessing the attractiveness of an individual opportunity you
could look at:
⚫Local competition - is there an area unserved? Is this a prime location?
⚫ Other sources of revenue - will the site enable large grocery/convenience store sales with
higher margins?
What are the growth prospects? - Is the population increasing? Will traffic flow change?"
"TELEMATICS 
MARKET ENTRY
Your client is interested in telematics (wireless service to vehicles). Should your client enter this
new market? If so, how?
They are a wireless carrier (like AT&T, Verizon, etc...)
They have their own stores and also distribute through retailers like Best Buy and Circuit City.","What is the client's core business?
They are a wireless carrier (like AT&T, Verizon, etc...)
Do they currently have distribution channels set up with retailers?
Yes.
To determine the potential for market entry, I then needed to do the following:
Define customer segments:
Individual Customers: Commuters, Local, Recreational
Corporate Customers: Sales force, Fleet vehicles (trucks, rental cars, etc...).
Government (police, municipal, etc...)
⚫ Define channels:
Auto Manufacturers, Retailers
⚫ Size the market for each
List risks and rewards of each
I recommended the retail channel (even though it has not become a big channel) because the market
penetration through auto manufacturers would be small (-1% of drivers per year for first 4 years of
sales) and time consuming (2-3 years from product design to release).
In making a recommendation to the client I would want to answer three main questions:
First, is this an attractive industry to enter
What is the market size? What are the growth prospects?
What are the competitive dynamics?
⚫ Second, is this industry appropriate for our client?
What are their core competencies?
Can they exploit their existing resources and capabilities?
Finally, can they enter the industry profitably?
What will it cost to enter the market and how quickly can they grow their share?
What will it cost to acquire and retain customers?
What revenues will they earn from each customer?"
"MANUFACTURING 
Your client is a private company that manufactures switches for machine tools. The switches
serve one purpose: to stop the machine instantly. Failure to do so may result in damage to the
machine and/or the machine operator. Given the following constraints, how can the company
make more money?
⚫ No changes can be made to the product line
You only have your current customers
No international expansion
Our switches (and our competitors' switches) have never failed.
⚫ Our customers have dealt exclusively with us for several years, although there is no exclusivity
contract.
⚫ The sales force has strong relationships with the customers, so they just take the orders each year.
⚫ Cost of machine tools that our customer makes: $60,000.

Competitor 1

Mkt Share (SIB market)

perceived quality of our product, I was told that it is comparable to that of both our competitors.
I made an observation that customers are not very price sensitive and suggested raising the price of
our product 20-25%. My interviewer asked why that number and not a bigger number, so I
defended my recommendation.
He then changed gears and asked me which company I would acquire if I could acquire one of
my competitors.
I mentioned anti-trust issues associated with acquiring Competitor 1. Then I did the math and
determined that it would be advantageous to acquire Competitor 2 (C2) and raise the price of our
switches to $125. This would provide increased revenue and would price us only 4% over our only
other competitor. Other aspects of acquiring Competitor 2 include the risk of turning off C2's
customers by a price increase, but they are unlikely to leave, since there is not much difference in
price between $125 (us & C2) and $120 (C1).
This is a common type of question that can be simply and effectively answered by using a standard
framework. I would approach it as follows:
If we are looking at increasing revenue then obviously we need to look at how we could increase
either the quantity sold or the price at which we sell our product. 
Looking first at our quantity, it appears there are a number of restrictions. You have mentioned that we
have only our current customers and that we cannot expand internationally. Other things we would
need to know are:
⚫ Do our current customers take all their product exclusively from us or do they take some
product from our competitors also? If they also take product from our competitors then we may
be able to increase our sales quantity by some sort of exclusivity arrangement - capturing all of
the demand from our existing customers.
I would also want to know whether there are other machines at our existing customers
factories that are suitable for our product but where it has not been installed. If so then
convincing customers to install our product in these other machines would be another way to
increase sales and we may need to look at changing or adapting our sales force and marketing
strategy.
Next, I would look at ways that we can increase price. We are told that we can't change the product so
we will need to determine if we can persuade our customers to pay more for the existing product. Do
we have any information on the prices and volumes sold by our competitors? (In response to this you
would expect to get the information provided in the case above)
We can see from our competitors' sales data that the competitor with the highest price also has the
highest market share. This suggests that we may be able to increase our price without adversely
affecting our sales (in fact it may even increase our sales if price is seen by customers as a proxy for
quality)
Before recommending a price increase however I would want to understand if there are any other
factors justifying our competitor's higher price and high market share. Do they have a bigger sales
force? Do they sell through different channels? Are they entrenched as the industry leader/standard?
Do they have better after sales service? Do we target a segment that is more price sensitive than our
competitor? [The answer to these questions may affect whether recommending a price increase is
appropriate. Given the way the case has been set up, it seems like the focus is going to be on price
elasticity so presumably most of these avenues would be closed down by the interviewer, but asking
these questions would help to complete the case answer in a MECE fashion.]"
"CELL PHONES 
OPERATIONS/SUPPLY CHAIN
Your client is a cell phone carrier in Western Europe in the late 1990s when growth is
exploding. The market as a whole is approximately 60% penetrated. Your client is concerned
because acquisitions costs (the cost to acquire a new customer) have been increasing at a 20%
CAGR over the past few years.
Your client wants to know why costs are increasing and what they should do.
Acquisition costs largely fall into two categories:
1. Handset subsidies (phones are given to clients for free)
2. Commissions to independent stores who sell the phones
Total annual acquisition costs are 200 euros per customer.","(The interviewer preferred not to have a framework set up and just have a dialogue).
Q: First I'd like to know more about the handset subsidies. Have costs been constant over time?
Have we always given them out for free? How much of the total spent do they account for?
A: Yes, we have always given them out. Total handset spending is 100 euros but they only
account for 5% of the total CAGR. What does that make the growth in commissions?
My answer: 35%
Q: Thinking about distribution, do we have any other outlets to sell our products. Are the stores
equally distributed from a geographic standpoint?
A: No
Q: How does the commission structure work? Are there different % paid based on different plans?
What has been the distribution of these plans now and in the past?
A: Let's assume that we have only one plan for simplicity all of the commissions are paid against it.
These plans represent the entire increase in commissions - there are no other marketing expenses
etc. Additionally, prices of the plan have been pretty consistent over time, so that is not accounting
for the increase in total commissions.
Q: I'm assuming that since commissions are increasing, it is becoming increasingly difficult to sell
to customers. As such, I'd like to explore our competitors and their plans? Have more entered the
market? Are their plans unique when compared to ours? How is their distribution channel? How
are their commissions when compared to ours?
A: The competitors have been consistent over time although competition is increasing since
everyone now wants a phone. Market share is consistent across the players and their plans are
non-differentiated. They have similar distribution channels (note-this was the interviewer's
response word for word. In reality, I later discovered they are the same distribution channels
down to the store). Commissions have been increasing at a similar rate to what we have seen.
Q: Ok, let's talk about customers. Have we seen any differences in where they go to buy cell
phones? Is their a preference in Europe for certain types of plans or phones and how do we compete
from that perspective?
A: Customers are buying cell phones through the same channels as always and our plans and
phones are competitive?
Interviewee's Solution (cont.):
Q: Well if nothing else in the landscape has changed, it must just be that we have to give competitive
commissions to our sales people to stay in business? Tell me, do they sell phones of competitors as
well?
A: Yes, they do. That's why we have to incentivize them so well. Now what do you think we could
do about it.
Well, I think there are a number of things:
• We could somehow signal the market that we are not going to continue to give escalating
commissions through a PR program.
⚫ We could try to differentiate our product offerings both in terms of the plan and the phones we
offer.
⚫ We could spend more on marketing (and hopefully, less on commission) in the hopes of helping
the consumer determine what type of phone they want before entering the store.
We could try to establish different distribution chains to reduce total costs; i.e. the Internet.
A good way to structure this case is as follows:
First I would want to understand the primary drivers of the increase in acquisition costs. To do
this I would like to find information on:
o each of the components that make up the total acquisition cost elements that make up
acquisition costs and
o how much each of those elements has been growing
Once we have identified the source of growth in acquisition costs I would then want to explore
the options available to reduce those costs.
In doing this I would want to focus on the aspects of costs that are the most significant
and that have been growing the fastest
I would also want to benchmark our costs against those of our competitors to determine
whether they use strategies that are more cost effective."
"EXPLOSIVES 
Our client is a large manufacturer of explosive products. Recently, their largest customer, a
mining company, has called for a competitive bid for their next 3 year contract. Previously, we
have been their preferred provider and have run uncontested. Our client wants to know how
we should price the bid.
Our client provides three products:
1. Ammonium nitrate (AN) which is used to create the explosion
2. Ignition systems (IS) used to start the explosion
3. Slot services which are contracting services designed to help clients understand where to
place explosives.
When asked why the bid was put out for RFP, the answer was that we are not sure but suspect it
could be internal cost pressures.","Q: I’d like to take a look at this by first analyzing the external factors currently impacting our client
(what the needs of the mining firm have been in the past and are now, what the competitive
landscape looks like, and how the industry’s product mix breaks down). Then I’d like to do an
internal analysis of the various options available to our client focusing largely on drivers of
profitability. To start, what do we know about this mining firm and their current contract?
A: The mining firm owns two mines, one in Kentucky and one in Wyoming. Previously, 80% of
the revenue of their contract has been derived from AN and 20% from IS. They don’t purchase
any slot services as they have their own people?
Q: You mentioned the contract from a revenue perspective but do we know what they purchased from
a volume perspective and at what cost?
A: They purchased 40,000 tons of AN at $1000 per ton and IS at $250 per ton of AN (there is a
predetermined ratio of how much IS you need per ton of AN).
Q: Great. Next I’d like to understand a little bit more about the competitive landscape. Do we know
anything about new competitors that have entered the market and how we compare to those firms?
A: Nothing has changed from a competitive standpoint as we have the same competitors as always.
We are generally seen as the market and price leader.
Q: From a product standpoint, how do we compare to those competitors?
A: AN is pretty much a commodity although we do charge about a $10 premium over our
competitors. From an IS standpoint, we are the clear leader and have a quality product for which
people will pay for.
Q: Do all competitors provide both products?
A: Our largest competitor does although they have bad ignition systems. There are other
competitors for ignition system abroad that are closer in quality to ours and AN can be purchased
from many places as it is a commodity.
Q: Great. Now that I know more about the industry landscape, I’d like to look at the current and
future profitability of this contract. We know that the client purchased 40,000 tons of AN at $1,000
per ton so that is $40 million in revenue. They also purchased IS at $250 per ton of AN so that is $10
million in revenue for a total of $50 million. Do we know the margins on these products?
A: Yes, AN gets a 20% margin and IS get an 80% margin.
Q: That means that we are making $8 million of profit off of each component of the contract currently.
What are the specifics of the future contract?
A: It will be for the same components in the same volumes as this contract.
Q: Since, the contract is the same as last time, we need to think about who we are really competing
against to determine price. In this case, it seems that no competitor offers as robust an offering as we
do. However, the customer still has the option to purchase the products separately on their own. Do
we know how much they could save by doing so? Also, what would it cost them in internal costs to
manage the process?
A: They could get the next closest IS system to ours for $100 per ton cheaper by purchasing
overseas. Additionally, let’s assume that they need 1 person @$100k per year to manage the process.
Q: That means they will save $4 million per year on their own although they probably won’t want to
do it.
A: If you think they don’t want to do it, should we charge them more for our integrated service.
Q: I wouldn’t advertise that to the customer even if we do decide to do it because it is poor positioning.
Also, when looking at the number, we could make $16 million in profit so by looking at the scope, I’m
not sure another $100k matters.
A: Agreed. So what should we do?
Q: Well, since AN is a commodity and since we make a much smaller margin on it, I’m not attracted
to trying to reduce price there. However, as we make a much higher margin on IS, and it would be
much harder for them to get these products from abroad, that may be a good place to reduce price if
that is the mine’s number 1 concern.
A: That makes sense. So what should we price it at?
Q: Working backwards, I’m not sure that we necessary need to give an entire $4 million price
concession to our client as they do know that we have a premium product. Instead, let’s reduce our
price by half that so that the maximum they will pay is $8 million for IS systems. That makes the
price $200 per ton. Does that seem reasonable?
A: It does."
"PHARMACEUTICALS 
Two large branded pharmaceutical companies are merging. The head of development (pre-
clinical and clinical) has a declining budget and wants to re-think his portfolio. He currently
uses a spreadsheet to evaluate his portfolio which contains columns for the chemical name,
estimated launch date, and lead indication. Essentially, your client wants you to add a column
for the current market value of the partially developed drug so that he can evaluate which ones
to push through development. How do you do it?
There are 60 drugs in development with 1/3 in clinical trials 2/3 in pre-clinical development.
It takes 10 years to bring a drug from pre-clinical to launch and there is large attrition along the
way.
Assume that this is a U.S. launch only, that there is no bundling, and that each compound
represents a novel therapy.","Q: To determine the market value of the drug, I would want to do an NPV calculation and so the two
areas I would primarily like to explore is revenue and costs. I'd like to begin with the revenue side of
the equation first and begin discussing the factors that influence volume. Should I begin with a
particular drug or should we talk in generalities?
A: I'd like to focus on the thought process you would use to do the calculation and so I am not
concerned about a specific drug. Generalities are fine.
Q: Ok. The first thing I would want to do is estimate the size of the market and consequently our
market share at the time of launch. To do that I'd like to know the # of people who suffer from a
particular ailment.
A: Where would you find that?
Q: You can go to all kinds of different sources like the American Cancer Society or the American
Lung Association who keep track of this information. In particular, I'd take the growth rate for a
given disease category over the past few years and use that to extrapolate what it would be when the
drug launches to get the total number of people with the illness. Next, I'd want to find out the number
of people who are generally treated for the disease.
A: And where would you find that information?
Q: Similar sources although I suspect I'd might also be able to look at analyst reports depending on
the type of therapy being evaluated.
A: Good
Q: Next, I want to discount that number by the number of people who seek treatment using a drug vs.
another procedure like surgery to get a true sense of the market. Then I would want to take into
account the competitive environment.
A: What in particular would you look for?
Q: Well, I would first want to understand what competitors are on the market now and where we
anticipate them being from a product lifecycle perspective when we expect to launch our therapy. In
particular, I'd want to drill down on comparisons between mechanism of action, indications, and
dosing requirements.
A: What else should you look for?
31
Interviewee's Solution (cont.):
Q: Knowing that new drugs are always being developed, I'd want to evaluate those that are currently
in the pipeline of our competitors and what we anticipate the impact of them being on the market at
the time of launch. You can find this information in publications like R&D directions as well as other
trade publications.
A: Sounds good. Besides volume what else should you be thinking about?
Q: Pricing. Pricing for drugs has a lot to do with demonstrated efficacy as well as whether you are the
first drug in a given class to be launched. Other things that you might want to consider include
convenience (dosing requirements) and other drugs used to treat the therapy even if the mechanism of
action differs.
A: Great. What about costs?
Q: From a cost perspective, I'd want to consider both fixed and variable costs. This would include
any new facilities that need to be built to manufacture the drug as well as the R&D and sales and
marketing launch costs associated with the product.
A: And what would you do with this information?
Q: I'd determine the free cash flow number for each year and then discount that back to the current
period. Additionally, since the process has high attrition, I'd also want to adjust for the probability of
success at each phase.
A: Great. Let's say you've done all this and it turns out that the compounds in pre-clinical
development have no value. How are you going to plug the hole from a revenue perspective?
Q: Any time you are considering product development there are two options - make or buy. Under
the make category, we could try to expedite the development of existing pipeline drugs to address the
gap but this is fairly unlikely to prove successful given the highly complex development process.
A: What else could address the revenue considerations if you can't expedite development?
Q: You could work with your existing portfolio of marketed products to increase the amount of
revenue you can get from them. This could include considering shifting them to over the counter
products or evaluating other indications for the drug. However. I suspect we may already be doing
this so it is unlikely to be all of the answer.
A: Good. What else?
Q: We can buy a product or a group of products to plug the hole. To do so, we should go through a
similar compound valuation exercise as we did for our portfolio but also take into account synergies
between our two organizations and the previous track record of the other company in launching
similar projects.
A: Sound good. Thanks.
This case is an interesting spin on the standard market sizing type of question - Rather than evaluate
one market, the candidate has to outline a general process for sizing the market for a number of
different drugs. Layered on top of this the candidate needs to demonstrate a good understand of the
process for deriving an NPV and the relationship between the NPV and the original market sizing
exercise.
The candidate has given a very good answer and there are a number of positive aspects worth noting.
including the following:
22
32
Before doing anything else, the candidate sets out a clear road map for tackling the question-
""I am going to do an NPV which will mean looking at revenues and costs""
⚫ The candidate clarifies the expectations of the interviewer - ""Should we be looking at
generalities or specifics?"" The last thing you want to be doing in a case interview is giving a
great answer that bores the interviewer because it is not the aspect of the question that they
were interested in.
⚫ The candidate has a clear and logical approach to sizing the market for each drug. Not only are
the steps sensible and meaningful but they are also readily verifiable by available data (such as
American Cancer Society data on the number of patients with a particular cancer condition). It
is quite common for interviewers to ask how you would go about getting the data to support a
certain step in you logic so it is important to be choosing divisions where this information is
likely to be available.
⚫ The candidate does not get bogged down when the interviewer changes the question. If you are
asked a new question, like how to fill a hole in the pipeline, then develop a new framework for
approaching this aspect - ""there are two options to consider, make or buy""
Similar techniques could be applied to almost any market sizing question.

"ELECTRONICS RETAILER (BCG - Round 2)
Your client is a major consumer electronics retailer who sells A/V equipment, computers,
content (CDs, DVDs), and software. Recently, the store has seen increased competition from
bricks and mortar stores like Wal-Mart as well as online retailers like Dell. Your client has 3
questions:
1) How is the industry evolving?
2) What is the winning retail model?
3) What should we do?
None provided","Q: To answer these three questions, I'd like to look in 3 areas. First I'd like to know more about the
current market including understanding customers, the products they are buying, and how these have
changed over time. Next, I'd like to take a look at the different types of competitors that are affecting
our company and our firm's profitability. Lastly, I'd like to know more about our client in terms of
their business model, including core competencies, strategic direction, and their store model, to better
understand what options are realistic. Is there a particular, place you would like me to start?
A: Before we get started, can you tell me what you think makes a successful retail model?
Q: Sure. I think there are several elements. First, I think that a retailer needs to have a clear
understanding of their customer base. This will drive two things: having the appropriate product mix
to serve them and serving them through the appropriate distribution channel (online vs brick and
mortar). Secondly, while the above two factors are critical, our client needs to ensure that they will
allow for profitability and so careful consideration needs to be paid to revenue and cost considerations.
Lastly, to the extent that is possible, we would want to make sure that our business model is not easily
duplicated so that we can maintain a competitive advantage.
A: Sounds good. Let's focus on the CD/DVD market. What are the differences between the two
categories?
Q: There are potential differences between consumers as DVDs don't have as high an adoption rate as
CDs. There are also potential differences between age groups of consumers - I would think younger
people might buy more audio products than older people.
A: Those are reasonable. What about in terms of title fragmentation?
Q: I would think that DVDs are much more consolidated in terms of titles as 10 blockbusters a year
probably account for the majority of sales. I'm not sure this applies to CDs which I would think have
a much wider distribution in terms of titles.
A: How do you see consumer buying patterns change?
Q: More and more, consumers are buying content directly. You can buy songs directly over the
Internet decreasing the need to buy entire CDs. You can also get video on demand removing the need
to buy DVDs.
A: So what are the implications of this?
Interviewee's Solution (cont.):
Q: From the perspective of our client, CDs and DVDs are not going to be a substantial part of their
business going forward because the ability to buy content directly from producers removes the
middleman. Our client will more directly need to rely on other parts of its product mix in order to be
successful. In the interim, it is critical that our client manage the transition carefully in order to
maximize the opportunity associated with this closing window which will likely last for several more
years.
A: Agreed. So, let's assume that we did some additional analysis and it turns out that our client
needs to double the volume of its other products to counteract this. Fixed costs don't grow in
proportion to sales - they grow on a 75% scale curve meaning that even though sales double now
FC are only 75% of what they were on a % of revenue basis. Our gross margin is 25% and net
income is 0%. What would our net income be if we doubled volume?
Q: Let's say that Year 1 revenue was $100 making operating profit 25 and fixed costs 25. In Year 2,
we would make $200 and our operating profit would be $50. Given the scale curve, our FC should be
about $38 giving us net income of $12 or 6%.
A: Exactly.
This is a fantastic sample case because the dialogue provided by the candidate demonstrates exactly
what the case interview experience can end up being like. Most importantly it demonstrates exactly
how that experience can differ wildly from what you were originally expecting, and what the case
interview books tell you to expect.
At the outset of the discussion, the candidate develops a framework for answering the question. All
they have to do now is walk through that framework right?
Wrong.
After the candidate sets out the framework, the interviewer then practically takes over, firing questions
at the candidate, choosing a particular market to focus on, and never really giving them a chance to
thoroughly walk through their carefully laid out framework. The poor candidate is left feeling totally
defensive, thinking on their feet to come up with answers to the interviewer's interrogation rather than
having the chance to ask the questions and gather information at their own pace.
If this happens to you (and it undoubtedly will), don't panic!! It is quite common and not necessarily
a bad thing. Despite not getting a chance to do their own analysis this candidate has still nailed the
case because they set out a good framework and gave intelligent answers to the interviewer's
questions.
This is my assessment of what is going on and why this happens so often:
. Case interviews are about giving the firm a chance to gain an insight into your thought
process can you think like a consultant.
⚫ The candidate set out a reasonable framework (not necessarily the only one but a
reasonable one) and the interviewer has taken this as a sign that they know what they are
doing. The framework in and of itself is 80% of the answer to the case.
The interviewer then chooses not to let you walk through the framework, either because
they are bored with having asked the same question ten times already that day or because
they think they doing so will give them very little extra insight into your thinking beyond
what they already got from hearing what your framework was going to be.
. Instead they choose to test you more deeply by asking you a series of questions that give
them more insight into your ability to really understand and think about a business
problem or market.
⚫Far from being a sign of failure, getting grilled with questions in this fashion may
actually be a sign that you are doing well.
Note, there is a fundamental difference between interviewers asking you questions to prompt
you because you don't seem to know what you are doing and interviewers asking you
questions (as in this case) because they are really testing you.
Don't assume you can sit back and let them ask you the questions they are interested in. You
cannot. You are always responsible for driving the case and you need to set out a framework
and start working your way logically through it. If however, at some stage during this process,
the interviewer starts firing questions at you then you need to be able to work with it.
Answer their questions as insightfully as you can and let them take you where they want to go.
Think about what things would be like in the real world - How would the CD market be
different to the DVD market? You must have had plenty of experiences with both so apply
some common sense and you are more than half way to a decent answer.
If the questions run out, then tie everything back in to your original framework and keep going.
But more times than not the questions will only run out when they bring you to a case
conclusion.
These interviews can be terrifying because you fell like you have lost control, but they can also
be the most rewarding and, in my view, are the ones most likely to earn you an offer."
"AERO INCA 
Your client is Aero Inca - Latin America's 2nd largest airline. The airline has a hub in Mexico
City and flies to North, South, and Central America as well as a handful of European and Asian
destinations. Recently, a number of smaller airlines have expanded and are flying to North
America directly, taking market share from our client and decreasing revenue and profitability
(which is heading towards the red). Your job is to advise on what we need to increase revenue.
Customers basically come from two areas:
1) frequent fliers who depart from Mexico City
2) Through put transfers to smaller cities that go through the Mexico City hub.","McKinsey: How would you think about increasing revenue?
Me: I would first think about the product mix that we offer in the following manner: (draw 2X2)
⚫ We can continue selling the same product to the same customer
⚫ We can sell the same product to new customers (maybe capitalize more on tourists than business
travelers for example)
. We can sell a new product to the same market (maybe offer new destinations to business travelers)
⚫ We can sell a new product to new markets (maybe new destinations to tourists)
McKinsey: That sounds good. Aside from the revenue side, what else should you think about?
Me: I'd also want to think about costs both fixed and variable that will ultimately affect the
profitability of these options. Fixed costs could include planes, the hub, and other equipment (like
baggage handling machines) that we need to run our business. Variable costs would include fuel and
labor.
McKinsey: What are some of the things that you can do to control costs?
Me: With regarding to planes, you can evaluate whether or not it makes sense to buy them or lease
them. With regard to the hub, we can consider keeping the hub in Mexico City or moving it to another
location. With regards to fuel, you can construct a hedge against future rises in prices (maybe build a
reserve). For labor, we could consider unionized vs. non-unionized sources.
McKinsey: Ok. So, when evaluating some of these options, the VP of network design comes to you
with a question that he needs the answer to by the end of the week. He needs to know whether or
not to increase flights to NY (which we already serve). This would mean that we would have to
cancel our two daily flights to Mango, Brazil as we need to use that aircraft to go to NY. How
would you decide whether or not to go to NY?
Me: At its core this is a profitability question. I would first want to calculate revenue for the new
route based on the expected price of the ticket and volume we expect. Then I'd want to calculate the
costs that we discussed before in terms of the NY route. I'd then compare this profit number to what
we were making on the Brazilian route.
McKinsey: Assume costs are a wash. How would you figure it out?
Me: I'd want to know the capacity of the plane used and the expected utilization of both routes as well
as the price per ticket. Do we have this information?
Interviewee's Solution (cont.):
McKinsey: The plane holds 200 people. For the Mango run, we get 60% utilization and a ticket
costs $500. For the NY trip, we would add 3 additional trips at a ticket price of $500. Utilization
is currently 80% on these flights.
Me: Ok, I can start doing some calculations. We would make $120,000 on the Mango route
(200*2*0.6*500). As far, as the NY trip, do we expect the same utilization to hold for new flights?
McKinsey: No, we expect utilization across all flights to be 70%.
Me: Ok, so we need to take into account the lost utilization on the first set of flights. How many are
we currently flying?
McKinsey: 12
Me: Ok so we are currently making $960,000 (12*200*0.8*500). Before beginning, the new route
calculation, do we expect any competitive response from our change in routes?
McKinsey: Yes. We expect the cost of a ticket to drop to $450.
Me: So, our total revenue on the revised flight schedule would be $945,000 (15*200*0.7*450).
That means overall we make $135,000 less on the new structure.
McKinsey: If that's the case what could our client do to maximize profitability on its current
Mango route?
Me: The first thing we should focus on is utilization. If we can get more passengers on each flight
then we can increase profitability.
McKinsey: Assume we can't.
Me: Ok, we can also evaluate the cost structure and what we specifically offer passengers. For
example, do passengers on these flights need meals or would they pay for them. We may be able to
reduce the number of flight attendants. As mentioned before, we can also look into the options of
leasing vs. buying the plane and hedging fuel costs.
McKinsey: Assume we've done all we can on the cost side.
Me: We may want to evaluate whether or not our profits would be increased if we only flew one
flight per day. Even though we wouldn't get as many customers it still may be more profitable for
us to only fly one flight.
McKinsey: Do you really want to leave customers behind?
Me: Maybe. I know that above a certain level additional passengers represent pure profit. So, if our
added 40% of utilization on one flight adds more profit than we are getting from only running 60%
on both flights, we may want to consider it. This also assumes that there would be no ill will from
the customers that now can't fly with the airline.
McKinsey: Sounds good.
On the whole this is a good solution. The candidate manages the analysis of the NY alternative
effectively and clearly defends the recommendation for one Mango flight rather than two in response
to questioning. The Candidate sets out a framework for revenue improvement (the 2x2 matrix) and
for assessing elements of costs. Potential weaknesses are that not all elements are necessarily covered.
The revenue framework does not mention the potential for increasing price, or driving higher volume
through lowering price and the cost framework does not necessarily capture all of the elements of the
cost structure."
"PHARMACEUTICALS II 
Our client is a pharmaceutical company with two divisions. Each division has a separate sales
force. Division I manufactures a diagnostic test (like a blood sugar test) and Division II
manufactures a pill or drug or treatment (say, Claritin). Does it make sense for the divisions to
combine the sales forces into a single sales force?
Division I requires a sales force of 75 people. Division II requires a sales force of 50 people.
Each sales person is equally effective at selling. Each sales person makes a certain standard
frequency of hospital visits each month to hospitals in their respective regions.
The doctors and health professionals targeted by the sales forces currently in place are in totally
separate parts of the hospitals and do not come into contact with one another.","I structured the discussion around benefits and costs. Benefits I mentioned were mostly synergies,
cost savings from being able to get rid of certain sales people, or higher sales as a result of more
freedom per sales person and therefore a chance to spend longer on each visit. Costs were extra
training, one-time severance pay, etc.
⚫ It was important to realize that the education and training of each sales force member was key to
their ability to add value and generate sales. Doctors saw sales people as true experts and trusted
advisors. It was very difficult to actually discuss numbers in this case, because so many of the
obvious differences were apparently ""assumed to be the same.""
In assessing whether or not to combine the sales forces we need to determine whether or not doing so
would increase profitability of the firm. This means that we need to look at both the cost and revenue
impact of the decision.
Looking first at revenue, we would need to determine whether combining the sales force will result in
generating higher sales. To assess this, I would want to know whether the two sales forces are
currently serving the same customers. i.e. are they visiting the same doctors at the same hospitals? If
so then there is the potential for the combined sales force to do a greater number of visits and thereby
sell a greater number of products by selling both products as part of the one visit. If however the client
of the two sales forces is very different, as the case facts suggest, then the potential for increased
revenue is diminished. Although travel time may be reduced, the staff member is still making two
visits to two different doctors in the hospital to sell the two products. In fact, revenue may fall if
combining the sales forces reduces the sales reps expertise in a particular drug meaning that they are
no longer perceived as a reliable and trusted expert. There would also be the loss of the benefits of a
strong relationship if some sales reps are made redundant and the remaining reps have to develop
relationships with a new set of doctors.
Next I would want to look at cost implications. This would include the one time implementation costs
of the decision, including retraining, severance, re-organization etc. There may however be ongoing
synergies leading to cost savings from servicing the same number of doctors with a smaller sales force"
"HOTEL 
(POST 9-11) 
BCG has been hired after 9/11 to look into quantifying the amount of damage to revenue
streams that has occurred in the Manhattan hotel business. How would you go about
determining/quantifying the impact, and how would you structure a recovery plan?
Hotels use a metric called ""Revpar"" which is equal to the average daily room rate % occupancy.
Revpar was $200 before 9/11, $125 for the remainder of 2001, $150 for 2002, and $175 for 2003.
⚫ I was asked to assume that if 9/11 had not occurred that the Revpar would have been flat for the
entire time period.
I was told that there were 100,000 hotel rooms in Manhattan. I was then asked to quantify the
revenue impact.","I structured my discussion by segmenting the market into US business travelers, international
business travelers and leisure travelers. I also tried to make a separation between individual hotels
and chain hotels, but it was clear that the case giver was only interested in looking at things on an
aggregate basis.
The key, I think, to doing well in this case is to focusing not only on quantifying the damage, but
also to coming up with creative suggestions for a recovery plan.
The quantification question is relatively straightforward multiplication once the candidate has
extracted the relevant data by asking appropriate questions.
The question of a recovery plan is more difficult. I would approach this question using the following
framework:
What were the primary categories of hotel customers before 9/11? e.g. tourists, business etc
• How much did each category pay? i.e. how much was each category worth?
How much has each category stopped traveling? e.g. where are the biggest losses?
⚫ Focusing on those categories with the biggest losses what are the main reasons why they have
stopped traveling? e.g. is it a perception of safety in NY for tourists? Is it a perception of
airport delays for business travelers? Etc
⚫ Once the main causes for the most important categories are identified I would try to develop
solutions focused on addressing these causes. This may take the form of marketing and sales
promotions or alternatively lobbying the government to take measures to make travel easier etc
depending on exactly what causes are identified as being most important to the most important
category of customer.
"
"CPG - BEER 
Our client is a CPG company. Assume they make beer. They are going through a merger.
Assume our client is Firm A (acquirer) and the target is Firm B. Firm A holds 20% of the
market and Firm B holds 10% of the market. A major player, Firm C, holds a leading share of
the market at 45%. The rest of the market is comprised of fringe players.
Can you find the cost synergies in the merger, and can you discuss their relative importance?
The companies (Firms A, B, C) each have only one major manufacturing facility.
Each company has one major brand in each of 3 areas:
(a) Flagship brands which are highly profitable
(b) Maintenance brands which are marginally profitable and
(c) Cash cows / ""milk"" brands which are non-growth but provide a steady source of revenue to
the companies.","• I discussed synergies, segmenting them into marketing synergies, distribution synergies, raw
material sourcing synergies, and then possible brand synergies (i.e. do we use the merger as a
chance to reposition brands, shut brands down, start new brands, etc.?).
• It was clear that the interviewer wanted me to spend much of my time discussing the issue of
brands and their impact.
• I then suggested 3 categories of strategic alternatives for Firm A, our client:
(a) Keep flagship brands of both Firm A and Firm B after the merger
(b) Shut one of the two brands down after the merger
(c) Keep one, but reposition the second instead of shutting it down completely, and
(d) Combine the brands into a totally new brand.
• Of my four options described above, I assessed each one in terms of the revenues and in terms of
the costs. I then was able to come to a logical conclusion about the relative level of risk – risk of
market share loss, risk of profit loss, risk of customer rejection, etc.
• The issue of Firm C stealing market share while the new (Firm A + Firm B) merged company
repositioned itself was important to recognize.

The initial question relates to the identification of synergies. I would structure my approach to this by
working through the value chain:
• Raw Materials purchasing – there may be some small economies of scale here in the
acquisition of ingredients (e.g. hops) but given these two companies are already major players
they are probably both already operating at scale so the cost savings here would probably be
minimal
• Production – the potential for savings here depends on how the companies currently operate. I
would want to know whether either company has excess capacity that could be utilized/eliminated post merger and whether there is the potential for consolidating the existing
manufacturing facilities. Depending on the answer to these questions the potential for savings
could be significant.
• Distribution – again this depends on how the companies currently operate. Are both
distribution networks currently at full capacity? Do they both distribute in different regions,
creating complementarities and the potential to expand distribution for the products of both?
Do they both have in house distribution? Or is distribution outsourced? Depending on the
answer to these questions the potential savings could be anywhere from zero to extremely
significant.
• Sales and Marketing – from the interviewee’s comments, it appears that this is the area that the
interviewer wanted to focus on. There may be the potential for some basic savings through the
elimination of duplication in head office marketing roles and perhaps the consolidation of
external agencies used for marketing work. There are also the more significant potential
synergies through the streamlining of branding. It is here that you could get in to discussing
what to do with each of the various brands and clearly the most important decisions relate to
what to do with the flagship brands. Depending on where the interviewer wants to focus, I
would probably recommend approaching this by saying that for each of the brands you have
three alternatives: keep the brand as is, reposition the brand, or terminate the brand entirely. In
making this decision for each brand you would need to consider the incremental revenue
impact for that brand, the incremental revenue impact for our other brands, and the costs of the
repositioning or closing down (if that is the decision). This is a relatively loose sub-framework
for this issue but you would expect that where you go will really be driven by the information
that you get from the interviewer."
"BENJAMIN CARPETS
Our client is a carpet manufacturing company, Benjamin Carpets. They produce a range of
commercial and residential carpets which they sell through various distribution channels,
mainly wholesalers although they do a small amount of direct sales to large accounts. They
operate a single factory, 5 days a week with 2 8-hour shifts.
They are considering the purchase of a new piece of equipment, a yarn printer that will enable
them to print (patterns and) colors directly onto carpet. They have asked you to assess whether
this is a good decision. What do you think?
1. The carpet manufacturing process:
(a) Current process: purchased pre-dye yarn, which is loaded onto spools in the order that
carpets are to be produced. These are then loaded onto the weaver, which weaves the
carpet, and then it is attached to the backing. This is then cut, rolled, and stored until
shipment.
(b) New process: purchase undyed yarn, which is loaded onto spools and then onto the
weaver. As this is happening, the printer prints color onto the carpet, and then the backing
is attached. The product is cut, rolled, and stored until shipment.
2. The machine costs $25M.
3. They produce 10M yards of carpet per year.
4. The machine has two primary benefits: cost savings and increased revenue opportunities:
(a) Savings include:
I. Inventory $.50/yd due to reduced stock of yarns needed
II. Labor $.25/yd due to reduced changeovers
III. Purchasing undyed yarn costs $.50/yd less
IV. The machine adds $1.00/yd in cost due to dyes, maintenance, etc.
V. Reduced obsolescence risk (not quantified)
VI. Increased just-in-time potential (quantified under inventory i.e. reduced finished
goods)
VII. Possible reduced overhead allocation due to volume increase
(b) Revenue opportunities include:
I. 5% of a 70M yard high-end carpet market (can be set up as an estimation exercise or
provided)
II. 30% of their current customers will ""trade up""
III. They are not production constrained
5. They sell carpet now for $16/yard
6. The carpet costs $10/yard (after these cost savings)
7. The high end carpet sells for $20/yard
8. Cost of capital is 10%","• Possible structures should realize that there are a few components to be considered here:
(a) Revenue increases or new customer possibilities
(b) Cost savings
(c) Necessity (e.g. due to competitive actions)
(d) Practicality (can this be done in our plant)
• This case focuses primarily on the cost savings and revenue increase possibility.
Key Points That Candidates Should Identify Through the Case:
1. Need to better understand what this machine does (carpet manufacturing process)
2. Realize what issues are key (i.e. factory size, most of the process is actually irrelevant)
3. Most or all of the possible areas of savings (inventory, labor, purchasing at a minimum)
4. The cost savings are marginal and can be simply multiplied by the yearly output
5. The relationship between cost of capital, machine price, and savings. Realizing that a finite
life will only make this worse
6. The possible areas of revenue growth (new customers, existing customer upsell)
7. The different contribution increase for new customers vs. upsell customers; the fact that we
should be assessing contribution, not revenue
The Math That Needs to be Done:
1. Cost savings:
(a) Sum of savings is $.25/yard
(b) Across 10M yards, this is $2.5M/year
(c) Ignoring depreciation, if the cost of capital is 10% this is breakeven. If there is a
finite life to the machine, this has a negative present value

2. Revenue increases:
(a) New high end is 5% * 70M yards = 3.5M yards
New contribution is (20 – 16)*3.5M = $35M/year
(b) Trade up is 30% * 10M yards = 3M yards. Here, the new contribution is =
(20-16)*3M yards = $12/year
(c) Total revenue increase = $47M/year, so this is a good investment"
"Maldovian Coffins
This case was given by McKinsey in first-round interviews and is a ""command and
control"" case. In this style of case, the interviewer allows the candidate to drive the case
initially to explore possible routes to a solution. However, once the candidate has laid
out a plan, the interviewer takes control and asks the candidate to solve a few specific
problems before coming to the final conclusion.
When giving this case, allow for some initial planning and brainstorming by the
candidate, but then firmly take control of each of the ""modules"" described below. Try to
move the candidate along through each of them, since in the actual interview only those
candidates that complete all of the sections will be considered to have done well. This
case tests mental horsepower and the ability to move to conclusions quickly.
Our client is a coffin maker in the Eastern European country of Maldovia. He has seen
substantial change in his market in recent years and is contemplating the future of his
business. Up until now, he has been in the business of building high-quality, hand-
crafted coffins largely by hand with a skilled labor force. Recently, however, he has
become aware of technology that would allow him to build machine-made coffins with
much less labor. Should he invest in this new technology, and should he even remain in
the coffin business in the first place?
Read this information well before you give the case. Note that this case requires you (the
interviewer) to drive key points in the discussion. Allow the candidate to formulate a
plan and then prompt him/her to consider each of the topics listed below.
Prompt: What strategic alternatives should the owner consider?
Good Answer: If the candidate doesn't get all of this, help them along since we need
to lay this foundation for the rest of the case - We need to decide firstly whether to
stay in business at all and if so, whether he uses the new technology:
⚫ Option 1: Sell the business to a third party
Option 2: Sell the assets of the company and shut it down
⚫ Option 3: Keep operating as is
⚫ Option 4: Keep operating and invest in the new technology
Prompt: How would you figure out the current value of the business?
Provide the following information if the candidate asks for it clearly and directly.
Market Size - If the candidate asks for the size of the market, first make him/her
brainstorm about different ways to determine market size. A good candidate should
come up with at least 4 different ways, such as:
⚫ Calculate from population growth, total population, and birth rate
• Review of death records for a period of time
• Take sample of number of obituaries in paper serving given population base
Calculate from population, average life expectancy
Now make them calculate the market size, giving them the following data:
Population of Maldovia:
4M
0%
Population Growth:
Avg Life Expectancy:
Age Distribution:
Burial Customs:
75 years
assume a flat age distribution (i.e. same number of
people at every age)
75% of deaths are buried in coffins.
Right Answer: 40,000 coffins purchased / year. Note that the candidate needs to
quickly realize that every year, 1/75th of the population will turn 76 and therefore (on
average) will die.
Price - Coffins are priced at $5,000 for a hand-made coffin.
Costs - Material accounts for 10% of the direct cost, while labor accounts for the other
90%. COGS is $4,800 per coffin. Fixed costs for the business are $700,000 per year.
Assume all assets are fully depreciated and ignore taxes.
Competition - Maldovian Coffins has a 10% market share and a relative market share of
about 1 (if asked, you may explain that relative market share is the ratio of the company's
market share to that of its nearest competitor.)
Market Trends, Regulation, etc. - If asked about any exogenous factors, simply tell the
candidate to assume that the market is expected to continue as it currently is.
The candidate needs to calculate the value of the business now. This is a mathematical
exercise.
Correct Answer:
Contribution Margin
= $200/coffin
x 40,000 coffins
x 10% market share
Profit
= $800,000
= CM - Fixed Costs
= $800,000 - $700,000
= $100,000
Assuming a discount rate of 10% (candidate can assume anything reasonable here as
long as they are consistent later) a perpetuity with cash flows of $100k/year has a
PV of $100,000/.1 = $1M. So the current business is worth SIM whether they keep
it or sell it.
Prompt: So now what is the value of the company if it were shut down and the
assets were sold?
Information to give if asked:
Assets - Since the firm has been building coffins by hand, the fixed assets are essentially
only the land and improvements. These are owned outright by the company.
When the candidate asks for the value of the land, have them brainstorm ways that they
might determine this. They should come up with at least 3 good ways, such as:
Look for comparable real estate and determine recent selling price
Find comparable commercial real estate and determine the rent per square foot,
then discount the cash flows generated by renting the property
⚫ Determine rate of appreciation for property in the area and then apply to book
value of current land and improvements
Give the candidate the following information and have them calculate the value of the
property:
Book Value of Land:
$20,000
Book Value of Improvements: $80,000
Years Owned:
48
Avg. Real Estate Appreciation: 6% / year
Right Answer: Using the ""rule of 72,"" a 6% growth rate will double the investment every
72/6 = 12 years. Since the property was held for 48 years, the current value will be
$100k (2^4) $1.6M.
Since the assets ($1.6M) are higher than the value of the discounted cash flows ($1M).
then it would make more sense to liquidate the business and sell the assets.
Prompt: What would the value of the company be if he invests in the new
technology?
Provide the following information if asked:
Investment - Investing in the new technology will cost the firm $1M.
Cost Savings - Material costs remain the same, but labor costs are reduced by 50%.
Proprietary Nature of Technology - The new coffin-making technology is being
offered for sale by a machine tool company, who holds the patent. They are not offering
exclusivity to any customers (i.e. they will sell to Maldovian Coffin's competitors if
possible).
Competitive Threat - It is not known whether the competitors have acquired or are
planning to acquire this technology.
Customer Preferences - While the machine-made coffins are not ""hand made"", the
quality perceived by the customer is the same or better. It is believed that the customer
will be indifferent between the quality and appearance of a hand-made and a machine-
made coffin.
Brand Impact - The candidate may argue that a machine-made coffin might negatively
impact Maldovian Coffin's brand. If so, ask them how they would test this (e.g.
consumer research), but tell them to assume that it would have negligible impact.
Good Answer: Since Maldovian Coffins has no proprietary control over the technology.
it is likely that competitors will also acquire it, resulting in an overall lowering of the
industry cost structure. If this is the case, price will also fall as competition cuts price in
an attempt to gain share. If we assume that gross margins remain the same, since the
industry competitive structure has not changed we can calculate the new margin
contribution as follows:
Gross Margin = $200/$5,000 = 4%
Labor Cost (4800 x 90%) x 50% = $2,160
Material Cost = $480
COGS $2,160+ $480 = $2,640
Price $2,640/(1-4%) = $2,718
Contribution Margin = $2,718 - $2,640 = $78
Loss $78*4,000 - $700,000-$388,000
So the introduction of the technology to the market might be expected to reduce industry
profits, making this business completely unprofitable.
Candidates could argue other scenarios, by assuming that the industry would be able to
maintain higher margins than we have assumed here, so the answer may be different.
They should recognize, however, that the introduction of this non-proprietary technology
will significantly reduce industry pricing in the absence of some other form of price
support (such as branding, collusion between players, etc.)","A star candidate will see that his/her time is nearly up and will present a
recommendation for the client without prompting. If the interview is within 3 minutes of
the end, ask:
""The owner just called and said he has an offer to buy his business. He needs to
know whether he should take it right now.""
Good Answer: Given the credible threat of the industry becoming unprofitable due
to the introduction of this new technology, the owner should look to sell the company
as soon as possible. Taking into account the assets of the firm and the present value
of the expected cash flows of the business itself, he should attempt to liquidate the
business and to sell the assets for around $1.6M.
If unable to sell the business now, he can continue to operate the business as a cash
cow, but should not invest in the business above what is necessary to keep it
operating at its present level. He should expect the business to become less profitable
as the industry moves to mechanization, and should eventually look to sell the assets
of the company and close the firm."
"HardHead Helmets
Our client is private equity firm considering taking private a leading manufacturer of
bicycle helmets. Should they?
Read this information well before you give the case. Share this information in each bullet
only if the candidate asks for it in a clear and deliberate way. For bullets with ""Explore
with candidate"" sub-points, make the candidate answer the associated question
completely.
Market Share - The company is the clear market leader with 60% share.
Competition - Existing competitors have small share. However, there are some new
entrants that are still small but growing quickly, including Nike and Reebok.
Channels - Historically, HardHead has sold primarily through the Mom-and-Pop
specialty bike retailer channel. Channel mix has recently moved to 50% discounters (e.g.
Wal Mart) and it looks like discounters will dominate in future.
Explore with candidate: How are these changes in distribution channel going to
effect the company's future prospects?
Good Answer: Margins will come under pressure from discounters. But more
importantly, competitors such as Nike will have a tremendous advantage in the
discounter channel due to greater scale and leverage in distributor relationship. Also.
a recognizable consumer brand (especially with the sports image of Nike) creates
competitive advantage in discounter channel where an expert bike-shop salesperson is
not there to push the HardHead product.
Cost Position - HardHead and all competitors are manufacturing in Asia, so costs are
very low. No competitor is likely to be able to realize any greater cost advantage.
Don't let the candidate get distracted in finding cost savings- this is not that kind of
case.
Regulatory Issues - In the last 5 years, most states passed helmet laws.
Explore with candidate: What impact does this fact have? Draw a graph of revenue
over the past five years and projecting into the next five years.
Good Answer: This drove a significant increase in sales as helmets were purchased
for the first time. This event will not be repeated, so sales will level off.
Customer Segments - The customer segments that HardHead sells to primarily are the
Adult Cycling Enthusiast segment, the Casual Biker segment, and the Under 18 segment.
Explore with candidate: How would you expect the purchase behavior to differ
between these segments? What does each segment want in a helmet?
Good Answer: Adults purchase a new helmet infrequently (only after a crash or
significant wear) while children must have new helmets every few years as their head
size grows. Adult Cycling Enthusiasts are more concerned about having the coolest
gear and tend toward more fashion-forward designs. The Casual Biker is more
conservative in their fashion but still wants something that looks cool. Childrens'
helmets are purchased by their parents who care about safety but influenced by the
kids who care about cool.
For strong candidate, explore: What would you expect the size of each of these
segments to be? What are the implications for HardHead's future earnings?
Good Answer: Let the candidate come up with all of the assumptions and then work
the math. Actual numbers don't matter much as long as the assumptions are
reasonable and the math is done correctly. Note that 100M households is the
standard assumption in consulting. Assume 100M households, 50% have children
with 2 children per household, 75% of children ride bicycles, therefore: 75M Under
18 customers. Assume 2% of adults are Cycling Enthusiasts, or 2M. Assume 20% of
adults are Casual Bikers, or 20M. Since the helmet laws created a large number of
one-time purchases, we need to rely on the Under 18 market and new entrants to the
adult segments for ongoing sales.
Product - From a safety standpoint, there is no new innovation in design. From a
fashion standpoint, there is much innovation, especially by the new entrants.
If the candidate is having trouble exploring all of the above topics, provide some
direction to help them along (e.g. ask ""Do you think that there might be any government
regulation that would impact past or future sales?"")","A star candidate will see that his/her time is nearly up and will present a
recommendation for the PE firm without prompting. If the interview is within 3 minutes
of the end, ask:
""The partner from the PE firm just walked into the room and wants to know if he
should do the deal.""
Good Answer: The short answer is 'No.'
HardHead has been experiencing exceptional growth due to the one-time
market expansion caused by new helmet laws and its historically strong
market share. This unsustainable growth would result in an overvalued
acquisition price.
⚫ New market entrants by Nike, Reebok and others will quickly steal share as
consumers gravitate toward the general sports-affiliation of these well-known
brands.
⚫ Bike helmets have been largely utilitarian, but the sports brands are likely to
quickly move helmets into the fashion arena, putting HardHead at a
significant disadvantage.
⚫ Furthermore, with the channel shifting strongly away from the specialty bike
retailers and toward the mass discounters, the national sports fashion brands
will have more leverage with the retailers, possibly commanding better
margins, placement, assortment, and advertising support.
The only scenario in which the firm might consider the acquisition is if they
have interest in another fashion brand that might be combined with HardHead
to allow it to compete against the new fashion helmet brands such as Nike."
"Verizon Security Services
This case was given by Mercer in second-round interviews. This is a broad, qualitative
strategy case and was given in a very open and conversational manner. No hard data was
provided - instead, the interviewer asked the candidate to come up with assumptions and
estimates to drive the case forward. Therefore, there is no ""right"" answer, but the
candidate must be able to come up with reasonable assumptions and then follow them
logically to a conclusion.
Verizon is the nation's largest provider of local telephone services. They are considering
entering the home security market. Should they?
Read this information well before you give the case. Give this case in an open-ended
manner. Make the candidate come up with his/her own assumptions and estimates for
everything. One set of reasonable assumptions is listed below-use these to steer the
candidate back on track if they seem to be off the reservation.
Market Size - If the candidate asks for the size of the market, make him/her come up
with assumptions and calculate the total market size. A sample calculation based on
sample assumptions follows:
Total Households in US: 100M
% Households Serviced by Verizon: 50%
% Households That Can Afford Service: 50%
Annual Subscription Price: $250
Total Addressable Market: 100M x 50% x 50% x $250 = $6.25B
Cost Structure - Ask the candidate to discuss what the cost structure might be for
Verizon to enter this market. What are the fixed costs? Variable costs? Does Verizon
have a cost advantage over other players?
Good Answer: The business has very little fixed cost beyond the infrastructure
already installed in potential customers' homes (i.e. the existing phone wiring).
Customer would need door / window / motion sensors installed, which could be done
by a third-party installer and billed to the customer at cost + markup and owned by
the customer.
Variable costs are also very small - essentially just the cost to maintain enough call
center operators to dispatch police when alarms are tripped.
Verizon does not seem to have much or a cost advantage over other players, since
they are all using the common carrier phone network. Verizon might have some
economies of scale in operating the call center, but this effect would be slight.
Competition - The market is composed of a large number of mom-and-pop alarm
company operators. No firm has over 5% market share overall, although there are some
strong regional players.
Customer Segments - Ask the candidate to speculate on the various customer segments
and their relative importance, size, and value.
Good Answer: We can reasonably divide the customer base into urban and suburban
customers, having different needs and different price sensitivities. Urban customers
are likely to have lower incomes but a high willingness to pay due to the increased
crime rate of the city. Suburban customers are likely to have a higher income but a
lower perceived threat due to a lower suburban crime rate. By first-degree price
discrimination, it may be reasonable to charge the suburban customers a higher price
because they are presumably less price sensitive. We can assume that 50% of
customers are urban and 50% suburban.
Pricing - Have the candidate come up with a pricing scheme and prices for each of their
identified customer segments. There is no right answer, but they must justify why they
are setting the price they are. Some areas they might consider:
⚫ Insurance companies generally give breaks on homeowner's insurance for having
an alarm. This will increase the EVA to the customer and can inform pricing.
⚫ What other services to homeowners pay for monthly? Cable, phone, DSL. How
are the values of these services perceived compared to the value of the alarm?
• Pricing will need to be competitive with other market players.
The candidate might assume a net margin based on the competitive landscape and
use this with assumed market size to determine attractiveness rather than
determining an end-consumer price.
Regulation - The market is not regulated and government regulation is not expected to
play a role.
Marketing - Ask the candidate what advantages Verizon might have in marketing vis a
vis its competitors. Keep points the candidate should identify include:
⚫ Verizon has monthly customer contact with a large pool of potential alarm
services customers through its phone bills.
⚫ Verizon already has brand loyalty for phone service, why not alarm service?
⚫ Shear size of the company (and deep pockets) make it more able to achieve scale
economies in marketing and reach a broad audience.","A star candidate will see that his/her time is nearly up and will present a
recommendation for the client without prompting. If the interview is within 3 minutes of
the end, ask:
""So, should Verizon enter into the home security market?""
Good Answer: Yes. Verizon possesses several small but important competitive
advantages for entering into this new market. It has economies of scale in call center
operations that will enable it to be highly cost-competitive in operating a security
network. It has an established brand that the consumer associates with reliability as
well as with networking and communications - the primary function of a home
security system. More importantly, Verizon already reaches 50M households every
month through its phone services bill that it could leverage to launch and market this
new service. Also, the company has deep pockets and the ability to advertise such a
service far more effectively than the small, regional competitors.
The size of the opportunity is large enough for Verizon to consider. Assuming a
potential market size of S6B in Verizon's territory, even at only a 10% share, Verizon
can add $600M in revenue. Given the low cost structure of this business and the high
perceived value to the customer, this is likely to be highly profitable revenue as well.
With Verizon's marketing clout and customer reach, the company should be able to
gain significant market share and become the national leader in this space."
"ABC Conglomerate
This was a first-round Bain case. It is fairly straightforward in the analysis, but the
difficulty lies in keeping the information straight between the three divisions. Give out
the information freely, but make the candidate ask for each piece of information for each
company. In order to crack this case, they will need to have neat and orderly notes and
be able to quickly form a mental picture of each of these different divisions.
Note that this case is also difficult because there is no information about the products or
industries. This is not important to the case, so don't make anything up - just tell the
candidate that they should focus on the information they have.
The CEO of a major conglomerate is dealing with poor profitability in each of his three
divisions: A, B, and C. What should he do to maximize value for his shareholders?
Read this information well before you give the case. The same information is available
for each of the divisions, but make the candidate ask for each division's information
separately rather than summarizing the data for them. Do not offer any information
without being asked specifically and concisely for it.
Division A
Competition - The firm is the clear market leader with 60% share.
Cost Structure - Manufacturing is done in Asia by all firms and is largely considered to
be as low-cost as possible.
Revenues-This division generates over 60% of the firm's revenues but gross margins
have been declining in recent years. The high fixed costs maintained by this division
have moved net income into the red as gross margins have declined.
Pricing - Prices have been becoming increasingly competitive. Division A has had to
price aggressively to maintain sales volume, even with its strong market leadership
position.
Market Trends - The overall market for division A's product has been shrinking in the
last few years and looks like it may continue to do so.
Customer Preferences - Customers are moving to an entirely new product category as a
substitute, and prefer the product category of Division A less and less.
Threat of Substitutes - A new product category is filling the customer need previously
served by Division A's product. Division A is not well positioned to enter this new
category.
Division B
Competition - The firm has only 5% and is one of many players in the market.
Cost Structure - This market is relatively new and it is believed that costs can be
reduced significantly from their current position.
Revenues - Revenues have been low but growing. The division is running a negative net
cash flow as it is currently investing in marketing, R&D, and plant capacity.
Pricing - A wide range of prices exist in the market currently with margins generally
high.
Market Trends - The overall market is growing at 10% a year and is expected to
experience significant growth in the near future.
Customer Preferences - This is a relatively new product category and consumers are
not yet sure what they want or like.
Division C
Competition - The firm has 50% share with only one other major competitor and a few
minor ones.
Cost Structure - The firm has significant economies of scale and has the lowest variable
cost in the market. Significant expenditures are being made in marketing, R&D, and
plant capacity in an attempt to grow revenues.
Revenues - Revenues have been strong with good operating margins, but have been flat
for the past few years.
Pricing - Division C has a price leadership position in the market.
Market Trends - The overall market is not growing and expected to remain flat for the
foreseeable future.","A star candidate will see that his/her time is nearly up and will present a
recommendation for the client without prompting. If the interview is within 3 minutes of
the end, ask:
""The CEO just called and wants to know what he should do.""
Good Answer: Clearly the conglomerate needs to rationalize its company portfolio
to maximize shareholder return. Each of the three divisions is in a different stage of
the market lifecycle and needs to be treated accordingly.
Division A finds itself in a declining industry with no apparent way to move into a
new product category. As the incumbent firms struggle to maintain volume in a
shrinking market, prices have fallen along with volume. Operating income is no
longer enough to cover a high fixed cost base and the company is bleeding with little
chance to recover. Division A should be divested immediately.
Division B is in an emerging growth market. While it is not making money today, it
is in a favorable industry and represents a strong investment opportunity. The
division should invest aggressively in R&D, marketing, and production capacity in an
attempt to become the market leader by developing differentiated, branded products.
Division C is the leader in a mature industry and has the ability to generate a steady
stream of cash for use in other investments - namely Division B. Division C should
streamline operations by eliminating all expenditures not directly needed to maintain
profitability and should be managed as a cash cow."
"Artificial Turf

Our client would like us to estimate the market for artificial turf. How would you
approach this question?
Read this information well before you give the case. Share this information in each bullet
only if the candidate asks for it in a clear and deliberate way.
This is a market sizing problem, so rarely is any more information provided. It tests the
candidates comfort with ambiguity. The candidate should lead the discussion and start
brainstorming on the uses of artificial turf:
⚫ Sports fields
o Football
o Soccer
。 Rugby
° Golf
Commercial businesses
⚫ Residential
⚫ Airports
Schools
o High schools
o colleges
After the candidate has identified some uses for artificial turf, prompt him to estimate the
number of schools in the US. (or any of the places where artificial turf is used)
Analysis
To estimate the market size of turf in high schools in the US we have to estimate the
following:
⚫ Number of schools
⚫ Number of sq feet of turf that is bought each year / high school
Price of turf / sq foot
We start by estimating the number of schools:
Number of schools in the US = Number of high schools + number of colleges + number
of community colleges
Number of High schools:
Population of US = 300 M (M=million)
Percent of population age 18 = 1% (assuming population is equally distributed)
Number of people age 18 = 300M x 1% = 3M
Assume 80% go to high school, then the number of people age 18 who go to high school
= 3M x 80% = 2.4M
Assume that on average there are 250 18-year-olds in a high school. Then the number of
high schools 2.4M / 250 = 9,600 high schools
Number of Colleges - bachelors colleges:
Population of US 300M
Percent of population age 19 = 1%
Number of people age 19 = 300M x 1% = 3M
Assume 25% of people go to college, then the number of 19-year-olds who go to college
= 3M x 25% = 750,000
Assume that the average size of graduating class is 400 students, then the number of
colleges is 750,000/400 = 1875 colleges
Number of Colleges - community colleges:
Assume 10% of people go to community college, then the number of 19-year-olds who
go to community college = 3M x 10% = 300,000
Assume average graduating class is 200 students, then the number of community colleges
is 300,000/200 1500 community colleges
Total amount of artificial turf:
Make the following assumptions:
⚫ price of turf = $10/sq feet
lifetime of turf 10 years
athletic field = 60 yards x 120 yards = 60 x 3 feet x 120 x 3 feet = 64,800 sq ft
adoption of turf 50%
Now we can calculate the market size for turf:
⚫ Number of schools = 9,600+ 1,875 +1,500 = 13,000
⚫ Number of sq feet of turf that is bought each year / high school = 1/10 x 50% x
64,800 3,240 sq feet
• Price of turf / sq foot = $10
Market size = 13,000 x 3,240 x $10 = $420 Million",The market size for artificial turf in schools in the US is about $420 Million.
"Retail Bank
Our client is the private division of a retail bank that has 100,000 clients, $500,000,000 in
revenues, and $150,000,000 in net income. Our client's goal is to double the revenues
and profits of the business in 5 years. Assess the feasibility of the goal. Prioritize the two
or three most important steps they should take in their action plan.
Read this information well before you give the case. Share this information in each bullet
only if the candidate asks for it in a clear and deliberate way.
Pricing: they make their revenues from interest and fees
Costs: transaction costs, salaries. The nature of the sale is one-on-one pitch between the
bank sales person and the customer. So the salary cost and the transaction costs tend to be
high.
Geography: They have a large presence in the North East and a moderate presence in the
South East
Products: They have 4 product lines, with the following ranks in revenue and profit
generation:
⚫ Private banking:
。 deposits
Revenues
1
Profits
1
o loans
Investment management:
2
3
。 brokerage
o advice.
o access
Trust:
3
2
State planning and trust
o Transferred death
Insurance:
2
Customers: 20-25% of customers purchase more than one product. 75-80%% of
customers purchase only one product. They are segmented into 5 groups:
Volume
Number of Customers
Ultra High:
$10M+
High Net:
SIM-$10M
Affluent:
S0.5M-SIM
Mass Affluent:
$100,000-$500,000
Mass:
$0-$100,000
5%
10%
20%
25%
40%
The Ultra High, High Net, and Affluent segments generate 60-70% of the revenues, while
the Mass Affluent and Mass segments generate 30-40% of the revenues.
Analysis
At this point the candidate should start analyzing the numbers to make fact based
recommendations.
Buyer selection: Since transaction costs tend to be the same for the different customer
segments, it makes sense to grow the number of the higher revenue generating customers
and decrease the number of the lower revenue generating customers. We can attract the
top 3 segments by marketing more selectively and doing promotions for higher income
customer groups. We can discourage less affluent customers by raising the prices on
them, giving them the option to add more profits, or switch to a competitor.
Cross sell: Since 75% of customers purchase only one product. There's an opportunity
for cross-sell between the different product lines. Assuming that we will only serve the
top 3 customer segments:
Revenue generated by customers in top 3 customer segments = $500M x 70% = $350M
Revenue generated by customers who only have one product = $350M x 75% = $262.5M
If we assume that the 4 types of products generate comparable revenues, then if we cross-
sell each customer 3 other products then the new revenue will be = $262.5 x 4 = $1,050M","It is feasible to double revenues and profits if we can only cross-sell our current
customers the other products in our business. The next steps Private Retail Bank should
take are:
⚫ Give incentives to the bank's sales force to cross sell different products to its existing
customers.
Do promotions for the top 3 affluent market segments.
⚫ Increase its prices in its bottom 2 mass market segments to ""fire"" its unprofitable
market segments."
"Coffee Shop

A friend asked me if I wanted to buy his coffee shop for $100,000. Do you think I should
do it?
Read this information well before you give the case. Share this information in each bullet
only if the candidate asks for it in a clear and deliberate way.
Location: The coffee shop is in Vail, Colorado
Products/Prices:
Cup of coffee, $4.00
Bottled Water, $2.00
Pastries, $3.00
Variable Cost:
All products have a 50% margin
Customers:
The shop serves mostly locals, not tourists, so demand is consistent throughout the year
Other Costs:
Rent was $500 per month
Wages (for 2 employees) were $8.00 per hour.
The shop is open 12 hours a day, six days a week
Tell the candidate that he can assume that the coffee shop will bring in consistent profits.
Analysis
This is a valuation question. So to get the value of the coffee shop we need first to get the
profitability.
Revenues
Estimate market size.
Assume that the coffee shop gets 10 customers per hour in slow hour and 20 customers
per hour in a busy hour. The first and last 2 hours of the day are busy hours. So the coffee
shop gets 20x4+ 10x8 = 160 customers/day.
If we assume all the hours as busy hours on Saturday, then we have 20x12-240 hours on
Saturday.
Number of customers/week = 160 x 5 + 240 x 1 = 1040
Number of customers / year = 1040 x 50 = 50,200
Assume 60% of customers order coffee, 30% order pastry, and 10% order a bottle of
water, then the spend is:
50,000 x 60% x 4+ 50,000 x 30% x 3 + 50,000 x 10% x 2 = $175,000
Fixed Costs
Rent 500 x 12 = $6,000
Wages $8 x 12 x 6 x 50 = $30,000
We can also make assumptions about utilities and insurance.
Profits
Profits = 175,000 x 50% -36,000 = $52,500
Assume a 40% tax rate:
Profits after tax = 52,500 x (1-40%) = $31,500
Valuation
If we assume that the coffee shop is in operation for 5 years and we use a 10% WACC,
then its value would be:
Value = 31,500 + 31,500/ 1.1 + 31,500/1.1^2+31,500/1.1^3 +31,500/1.1^4 = $131,000","As long as the sales would be consistent for the rest of the 5 years, it would be profitable
to buy the coffee shop. Further analysis could be done on the management experience
and the competition to ensure that sales would be consistent."
"S SOFTWARE

An US software company wants to offshore its engineering/designing unit to India, as
well as to penetrate into the India software engineering market. Should they do it?
Read this information well before you give the case. The candidate is supposed to figure
our following information by asking appropriate questions. The interview style is
pleasant but reserved.
Since it's a two-fold question, a strong candidate will begin with laying out a clear scope
and then gather relevant information to analyze the situation.
Off-shoring is critical to access local market
No
Offshore but also find
out other critical factors
to enter the India
market
Yes
Definitely offshore
Other benefits
of off-shoring
Significant

Market Share - the company is the industry leader in US with close followers chasing
behind.
Profitability - declining (unknown reason, but increasing labor costs can be a reasonable
assumption).
Capability strong engineering department in the US.
Cost - R&D is the major cost and Indian engineers are estimated to be 1/4 of the cost of
the US engineers with the same technical capability.
Customer-
Has a strong existing customer base in the US.
Customers care about the quality of service, but are also considering lowering
cost in the long run.
A strong candidate should follow up with questions about customer segmentation.
⚫ Most of S Software's clients are medium to large companies in US.
⚫ The most profitable clients are large companies in developed countries where S
Software already has a strong base.""
⚫ S Software doesn't have any international presence yet.
Competition - US
Key US competitors are all off-shoring in order to lower the cost.
Competition - International
The growth of the international market is impressive compared to the more
mature and stable US market.
⚫ Key competitors are expanding their international business aggressively.
⚫India is one of the fastest growing international markets as well as the one with
the largest market size.
A strong candidate will get the hint that entering the international market, especially the
India market, is critical for the company to both fulfill current customer's emerging
needs of cost saving and grow its future business. He/she should then start to compare
the competitive advantages between large US companies off-shoring and local Indian
players.
US companies
Indian players
Ability to fulfill customized needs
High quality services

Access to most profitable clients
0
Cost advantage

O
Local client government / supply

0","The short answer is ""Yes"". The situation falls into the upper left corner of the matrix
because-
In the long-run, even current customers with established relationship will need to
look for cheaper alternatives. S Software can offshore its R&D to lower the cost
but still keeps its customer service team in the US to maintain the high service
quality.
Although clients in the developed country are more profitable, the actual growth
of the market is limited. Developing markets like India might not be as profitable
as the US, but with the huge and growing market size, even capturing a small
percentage of the market can provide substantial profits.
.
S Software might lack knowledge of the Indian market, but its strong customer
relationship management skills, large existing customer bass, and the understating
of unique customer needs can be further leveraged in India. In addition, hiring
local talent or partnering with local companies can help solve the concern of the
lack of local knowledge.
The legal risk as well as the political risk in India can be considered low."
"H HEALTH

A US health care provider suffered a profit decline last year. You are hired to solve this
problem.
Read this information well before you give the case. Basic information should be given
as the candidate asks for it, but the rest of the interview is very directive. The candidate
is supposed to follow the direction and do the math confidently. The interview style is
pleasant and helpful.
Background Information
⚫The key revenues come from commissions.
⚫H Health signs contracts with patients and provides medical services.
H Health has 300 contracted physicians.
⚫ A ""referral"" is necessary if certain medical treatment/service can't be provided by
H Health's contracted physicians.
Question 1: How would you approach this problem?
Answer:
Profit Revenue - Cost
= No. of patients* (unit price - variable cost) - fixed cost
The candidate can be creative to come up with possible reasons for revenue decrease and
cost increase. Some examples -
Revenue declined:
-number of patients dropped
unit price dropped
competition grew their market share
Cost increased:
VC: number of visits increased (e.g. major flu), per person cost increased (e.g. cost of
the medicine), referral cost increased
FC: physician's salary increased
Question 2: Competitor analysis why is our referral cost higher than the
competitor?
H Health
Number of patients 300,000
Referral cost
Sunshine
500,000
$20 (per member, per month)
$15 (same)
Answer: (again, the candidate is encouraged to be creative)
Economies of scale
Lower administration costs
More contracted physicians
Question 3: Assuming none of the contracted physicians have the specialty of
cardiology, estimate the number of referrals per year for cardiology based on the
following information:
Number of patients: 300,000
20% of the total population is > 65 years old, and 30% of them need treatment
For the rest of the population, there's a 10% chance for them to require the
treatment
The treatment usually requires 5 visits to the doctor per year.
Answer:
>65 years = 300,000*0.2*0.3 = 18,000
<65 years 300.000*0.8 0.1 = 24,000
ar=2
42,000*5 times/year = 210,000 (times/year)
Question 4: The actual number of referrals is 300,000. Why is it higher than the
estimate?
Answer:
H Health's clients do not have the same weight between different ages as the total
population
They underestimated the number of visits per year
More demanding patients ask to be referred even if they don't have such issues
Physicians refer non-cardiology patients because they don't want to take the risk and
are not motivated to provide services even if they are capable
Question 5: How much does the number of referrals have to decrease in order to
justify following incentive plan to encourage contracted physicians to be more
responsible?
Incentive plan:
Bonus: $100,000/year to top 10 physicians with the lowest referral rate
Training: $1,000,000
Referral cost: $200 per referral
Current no. of referral: 300,000
Answer:
Total cost 2,000,000
2,000,000/200 10,000
Question 6: If the incentive plan can reduce the number of referrals by 5% for year
one and 2% for year two, what is the total saving?
Answer:
YI
300,000*5% = 15,000
Y2 (300,000 15,000)*2% = 5,700
Total saving (15,000 + 5,700)*$200 - $2,000,000*2= $140,000
Question 7: Apart from Cardiology, how can H Health improve the number of
referrals in general?
Answer:
Increase training to improve physician's capability
Extend the incentive program to other departments
Improve the quality of relationship with the patients and build up the trust
Improve/remove physicians who are outliers with extremely high referral rate
Increase the no. of contracted physicians
Partner with other health care provider to lower referral cost","According to the example of cardiology, H Health should improve its profitability by
lowering the referral cost. H Health can
⚫ reduce the number of referrals, and/or
⚫ reduce the cost per referral"
"H HOTEL
You are hired by H Hotel to advise whether they should raise their daily room rate from
$160 to $180.
Read this information well before you give the case. There's very limited information to
begin with, therefore the candidate is expected to ask questions, but in a structured way.
Allow 10-15 seconds for the candidate to layout his/her assumptions for each step of the
analysis before giving any clues. Certain level of stress should be created but the overall
interview style is pleasant.
Industry Overview
Overall market: stable.
⚫ Segmentation: the hotel industry can broadly be divided into two segments that
serve different customer needs one for business purposes and the other for
vacation.
Exploration: Let the candidate characterize each segment. For example: business
hotels usually locate in the center of metropolitan areas, are smaller in size
compare to the average vacation resorts, are better equipped with in-room business
services like internet/fax/printer, and are more flexible in booking. Vacation hotels
have to be in a touristy or scenery area but not necessary in the center of it, have a
wider range of price and facilities, and with more fluctuations in demand.
⚫ Competition: The client is the leader in the Business Hotel segment and an
average player in the Vacation Hotel segment.
Internal Company Analysis
⚫ The client decided to focus on the Business Hotel unit. Why do you think they
made such decision?
Answer:
1) Location advantage: since the client is already the leader in this segment, they
must have already blocked the best locations in most of the big cities.
Competitors are hard to compete with this given the fact that the supply of space
in hot spots is very limited.
2) Steady revenue stream: once contracts with big corporations are signed, the
demand of business traveling is much easier to predict than vacation hotels
which contributes to a higher occupancy rate. In addition, a fixed price can be
set more easily.
3) Lower maintenance cost: business hotels tend to be smaller in size and need
less recreational facilities.
From an internal view of the company, why do you think they wanted to increase the
price?
Answer: To increase profitability.
Does it make sense from H Hotel's internal view?
Answer: The usual Profit = Revenue - Cost Price Quantity (Fixed Cost +
Variable Cost) function should appear here. Hint the candidate that there's not
much room for cost saving by saying ""they already outsourced the cleaning service"".
""they just went through a major layoff and cut the staff by half"", ""their restaurant
and bar are operating efficiently"", etc. On the revenue side, both increasing quantity
(occupancy rate) and price (room rate) can increase H Hotel's revenue.
External Consumer Analysis
How is the price increase going to impact consumers' behavior?
Answer: The candidate should look into both the ""end user"" (the actual business
travelers) and the ""customer"" (the corporations that H Hotel has contracts with).
The impact on end users is limited since they don't pay for it. They won't stop
staying at H Hotel as long as the service level, flexibility, location, and other
conditions remain the same.
For the customer, most of them have long and stable relationship with H Hotel
(that's what makes H Hotel the leader of Business Hotel) will only leave if
1) the price is not competitive compare to H Hotel's competitors (in this case it's
still competitive)
2) the price exceeds the cap of its traveling expense (in this case the cap is $240)
3) no extra benefits come with the price increase (in this case H Hotel provides
better services, more business friendly facilities, etc.)
⚫ Assuming H Hotel successfully increased the price, what can they do to the ""end
user"" to increase demand?
Answer: Let the candidate e creative here, but make sure they hit following points.
Differentiation: On the product side, H Hotel can improve its convenience (e.g.
provide transportation/get the hottest spot in the emerging area of a city), increase its
business friendliness (e.g. in-room fax/printer), and upgrade its rooms, etc. For the
service. H Hotel can create a more personalized experience for consumers by
keeping track of each traveler's special demand, set the room differently, etc. One
step further, H Hotel can also lock consumers in by offering traveler specific
promotion (different from the ones for the corporate), such as offering free gifts to
the consumers (e.g. shopping coupons) or cross promotion between H Hotel's
business hotels and vacation hotels (e.g. free stay at one of the vacation hotels when
the traveler takes his/her family on vacation next time).","A star candidate will see that his/her time is nearly up and will present a conclusion
without prompting. If the interview is within 3 minutes of the end, ask for the conclusion.
Answer: The short answer is ""Yes"".
H Hotel has competitive advantage given its superior location, good service, and
trust worthy relationship with long term customers. Given such strong base, there's
room for H Hotel to increase its price with further differentiated product and service.
Even after the $20 increase, the price is still far below its customer's ceiling and
remains competitive among its competitors. Furthermore, H Hotel can still grow its
sales quantity by locking travelers who have several business hotel choices in by
adopting traveler specific promotions.
⚫ From an internal point of view, cost saving has reached a limit. H Hotel has to
improve its profits by top line growth. As long as price doesn't effect quantity
(occupancy rate), total revenue will grow.

"Bubble Gum Manufacturer
Question (posed by interviewer):
You are a consultant working for a bubble gum manufacturer. The CEO of the gum
manufacturing company is concerned because his company is experiencing declining
margin. My questions to you are: (1) the reasons behind declining profitability (2) your
suggestions for improving profitability
Interview Guidance (general information to be given if asked):
Sales have been increasing
If asked about cost composition, ask the interviewee to brainstorm potential cost buckets:
 COGS: gum, sugar, flavor, smell, color
 Labor
 SG&A
Raw material cost has not changed (i.e. the unit cost is the same but total cost could be
different depending on product composition. ***This is the key to the case so don't give
the information about the unit cost to the interviewee too early in the interview.
Remember to push the interviewee so that she comes to the conclusion herself***)
Product portfolio 2 types of products: flavored and flavorless gum
Both products are sold at the same price point.
Composition products:
 Flavored gum raw material: gum, sugar, flavor, color dye
 Flavorless gum raw material: gum, sugar, color dye
Gum, Sugar, and Color Dye raw materials are same in size for each of the two products.","Logical Conclusion:
Profitability has declined because sales of flavored gum have been increasing, which
means that raw material consumption is also increasing because flavored gum requires
the additional flavor component. This added with the fact that the price of flavored gum
is the same as non flavored gum, means that, essentially, costs are now rising while
revenues are not. To improve the profits of the company, interviewee should come up
with 4-5 suggestions (raising price of flavored gum, sourcing cheaper flavors from other
suppliers, negotiate with existing suppliers to reduce the flavor cost, vertical integration
of flavor manufacturing company)
Successful Roadmap:
The key focus of this case is in the product mix. Most interviewees may be really
confused when they get the info that sales have been rising and cost is constant. First,
don't guide them into the product portion right away b/c this is the topic that they should
explore themselves. Logical buckets that interviewees should expore are Sales trend, cost
trend, cost composition, product mix. The conclusion should be concise as indicated in
the logical conclusion section. For the answers to the second question (how to improve
profits), great interviewees would present two type of options (short term (easy to
implement, quick wins) would be to negotiate with existing suppliers / look for other
suppliers, long term (vertical integration)). When discussing price change, you should ask
interviewees risk regarding price increase and how they are planning to cope with it. For
example, customers may buy less of flavor gums b/c of price increase. However, you can
offer value-added product such as low-cal flavor gum & do promotional/marketing
efforts to justify price increase."
" Widget Manufacturer in Brazil
Question (posed by interviewer):A widget manufacturer in Brazil has a 60% national market share and has a leadership
position in South America. However, it only has a 5% international market share. The
top 20 clients buy 80% of its products and the manufacturer is concerned with increasing
margins and exploiting new sources of revenue. Their CEO has asked you to gather data
and brainstorm potential ideas for increasing margins and market share.

Interview Guidance (general information to be given if asked);Market Information:
■Market is growing at 5%
■ No significant competitors in the region
■ Greatest threat comes from U.S., Chinese and Indian imports
■ Premium pricing for national customers
Company Information:
Plants are operating at 100% capacity
■ Plants can't shift from producing one product to another
■Currently company sells products directly to customers
Interviewee should ask to understand the products and profitability of each. Remind
them that the company sells its products in local and international markets. ***Please
use Exhibit A when asked this question***
Interviewee should ask about the breakdown of international and national markets.
***Please give Exhibit B when asked this question***
■ Ask them to calculate profit margins (should use the unit costs in Exhibit A).

Product A is more profitable nationally
Product B is more profitable internationally
Product C has the same margins for both markets
","Logical Conclusion:Product A is more profitable nationally while Product B is more profitable
internationally. (Please see Exhibit C). For national markets, the client should consider
reducing prices to gain market share from India, China, and the U.S. to maintain their
leadership position. They should also consider developing new products in partnership
with local clients and establishing new distribution channels to better serve smaller
clients. Internationally, the client should seek support from the government to aid in the
export of products. For example, create commercial partnerships at the government
level. They should also consider acquiring a company in the markets they would like to
enter as well as setting up distribution channels to reach these customers.

Successful Roadmap:The interviewee should understand the market dynamics, which products are more
profitable than others and where this happens, and should brainstorm to figure out how to
exploit this information.

","Logical Conclusion:1. Growth efforts should be concentrated in cross selling more profitable products to
current customers since average number of products held by customers is low. 2. Client
should adopt more aggressive sales and marketing techniques to gain more market share
in credit cards. 3. Client should partner with or market to employers to capture a new
generation of bank customers fueled by employment growth, and partner with real estate
developers, as well as car dealers, to finance future home and car purchase.

Successful Roadmap:Candidate should spend most of his time brainstorming all the factors that should be
considered to understand the situation. He will locate problems and potential solutions by
probing interviewer for information. After all, or most of the information is given,
candidate should make his best guess on what the potential recommendations should be
for the client. Any logical recommendations supported by information given or any
assumption he may make will be accepted. A good candidate should be able to
summarize his understanding and make a logical hypothesis on potential
recommendations.

"Retirement Homes
Question (posed by interviewer):Our client is a company that owns and operates retirement homes in US. They just
opened a new retirement home in Chicago about a year ago and they have concerns about
its profitability. So, we were hired to fix the problem.

Interview Guidance (general information to be given if asked):Location:

","The cost of operating the new retirement home is higher, however it alone tells nothing
about the problem our client is facing. Let me go ahead and calculate the margin that is
generated in different homes. The new retirement home not only has higher costs, but it
also has higher revenues. Consequently, margins generated by each home are pretty
consistent and, if anything, the new retirement home generates higher margin in both
absolute and relative terms. Having analyzed the performance of the new retirement
home and compared it to the performance of a typical retirement home that our client
operates, we reached the conclusion that our client has no profitability problem. The new
home generates 61 000 margin versus 53 600 in old home or about 17% in both cases. On
the other hand, there are some significant differences in cost structure for the new and old
retirement homes, so we can study it in more depth and potentially reduce costs in both of
them to generate higher margin."
"R&D Portfolio
Question (posed by interviewer):You are part of our team working for a Pharmaceutical manufacturer. We've been asked
to look at their current R&D portfolio and assess whether they're maximizing their
potential with their current projects. My questions to you are: (1) How can you help
them decide what information you would need and (2) What components do you think
would round out a portfolio for this company?
Interviewer Guidance and Information to be given if asked:
Current staffing needs are at equilibrium and layoffs and hiring are not expected to be
necessary
***Remember to make them brainstorm. You want them to come up with categories for
this company to consider when developing their R&D portfolio. For any questions, make
sure you keep them on track with this goal. They should be naming different areas to
look at (i.e. investing in current projects versus Investing in creating new business)***

Logical Conclusion:The company should be considering looking at multiple areas of its business such as
whether the R&D is for new business or current business, new technologies versus
current technologies, spread of projects across your business units, big projects versus
small projects, high dollar investment versus low dollar investment, short duration
projects versus long duration projects, etc. (There may be a few others but these are the
pertinent ones.)
Additional Requests, Attachments, Etc:
Interviewer - When the interviewee has provided their conclusion for the areas they think
the company should be looking at for a successful mix, please ask them to pick two and
create a 2x2 diagram for you. Please ask: ""If you were to look at these two areas, how
would you suggest breaking up the expenditure."" ***Please see example attachment for
the appropriate 2x2 graph and sample calculations***
If asked how much the R&D expenditure is annually, answer with $1M, but this is not
relevant to calculations and they can be done using percentages only.

A successful interview would follow this ""logical path:"" (1) Develop a small framework
from which they follow. Potential framework categories include Revenues and
Expenses, Regulatory Environment, Internal Issues, etc; (2) Start asking appropriate
questions based on this roadmap. (example: ""I would really like to look at the current
state of finances for the company. There is the possibility that for expense reasons, they
may not be able to heavily invest in a lot of R&D Projects."" (3) When prompted,
conclusion should be short and sweet. ""In my opinion, this pharmaceutical company
should really focus on 4 different categories. These are large investment versus short
investment, longer projects versus shorter projects, new business versus existing
business, and the mix over different business units. These will allow it to maximize its
spending investment and reduce their risk by not being overly invested in one area."" (4)
The 2x2 should follow. It doesn't matter which areas they pick to compare but the math
should be easy. If there is a problem with the math, an easy prompt can be given without
too many ""points"" being taken off."
